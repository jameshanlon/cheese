We ran our third Energy Tracer training weekend on the 20th/21st October, which
was held at the [Ambition Lawrence Weston](http://www.ambitionlw.org/) youth
centre. The training was a full two days and included the theory of thermal
imaging and building construction, and introduction to the CHEESE thermal
imaging equipment and hands-on experience with some practice surveying.
