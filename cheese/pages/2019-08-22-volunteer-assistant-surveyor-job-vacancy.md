## Job description

To assist in thermal image surveys of the interior of homes in Bristol with the
object of improving the energy efficiency of homes.

The award-winning not-for profit C.H.E.E.S.E. Project is gaining both local and
national recognition having carried out over 300 thermal surveys in Bristol in
four years using our unique low-cost system. These allow highly targeted
low-cost retrofit, for example by using DIY techniques to stop the draughts
that can waste up to a third of the heat in a home. Our aims are warmer homes
and a cooler planet. We do however operate on a tiny budget and it is hard to
get grants, so we must rely on volunteers to expand the project’s important
work. Your contribution can make a valuable difference to carbon footprints and
is always really appreciated by the householder.

As an assistant Energy Tracer™, you can learn how to operate the C.H.E.E.S.E.
thermal imaging equipment, how to interpret thermal images, and the basics of
building construction and energy efficiency. As well as this, you will have the
opportunity to work with people committed to action against climate change.

This opportunity begins with a brief training session in our unique method of
thermal surveying on Sunday 6th October. We are seeking volunteer workers,
according to your availability, for daytime, evenings and weekend surveys until
the end of April 2020 in the greater Bristol area (with two weeks leave over
Christmas/New Year). Local travel expenses will be paid. There may be an
opportunity to progress to being a paid Energy Tracer™ surveyor with additional
free training. Our work will continue the following cold season (November 2020
- 30 April 2021). Due to the availability of householders and the nature of our
surveys it may involve, at times, working during the evenings and at weekends.
We prefer you to commit to an average of at least two surveys per week, lasting
2.5 - 3 hours, over the survey season. Depending on the size of the house,
surveys take from 2.5 to 4 hours, and surveyors always work together with a
volunteer assistant.
