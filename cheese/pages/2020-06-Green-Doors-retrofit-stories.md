The [Centre for Sustainable Energy](https://www.cse.org.uk) have recently
released a [set of videos providing interactive tours of
homes](https://www.cse.org.uk/news/view/2471) that are featured in last year's
Bristol Green Doors showcase. In episode 5 of Simon Pyne's 1950s detached home
in Sea Mills, he describes the CHEESE survey he had, the faults it identified
and the remedial action he took.
