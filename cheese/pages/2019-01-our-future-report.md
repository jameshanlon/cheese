The newly published Our Future report is part of Bristol's One City Plan.  'Our
Future' lays out the following targets for the city to achieve:

 - Nobody suffers a cold home by 2028.

 - Make all existing buildings energy efficient by 2030.

The CHEESE Project has a big part to play in helping to achieve these targets.

The overarching Vision statement of 'Our Future' connects directly with our
work:

# Vision

A city where we can live good lives with just a fraction of the energy we use
now, powered by renewable energy, and where no one goes cold in their home in
winter

In the Report's "Energy' section, CHEESE contributes to the following points:

## Point 2: Make all existing buildings energy efficient by 2030

Most buildings in Bristol - residential housing, non-domestic buildings and
commercial spaces - are not energy efficient, wasting much of the energy
intended to heat and power the people living in them and their activities.

The city could make huge reductions in its overall energy demand by
significantly improving the energy performance of all buildings. Building
improvements would also

help reduce fuel poverty and mitigate the worst health impacts of the likely
increase in the frequency of heatwaves.

Over half of the city’s buildings require retrofit activities to achieve at
least an accurate Energy Performance Certificate (EPC) rating of C by 2030\*.
Activities should focus on measures to lower carbon emissions and improve
energy performance. Development of some exemplary low carbon retrofits of
heritage buildings could demonstrate how to overcome common limitations
associated with older structures.

**Key indicator**: % of existing buildings with an EPC rating of C or above.

## Point 5: By 2028 nobody suffers a cold home

One in 8 of the city’s households are in fuel poverty and struggle to keep
their home affordably and healthily warm in winter\*. Often, the most vulnerable
households’ energy supply is via the most expensive tariffs and those most in
need have to pay more to heat their homes.

There is a clear link between a wide range of health conditions and living in a
cold dwelling. Ensuring everybody in Bristol lives in an affordably warm home
would therefore have a positive impact on physical and mental public health,
and so reduce demand on the health service.

Key efforts must be made in the private rented sector to set and enforce new
minimum standards for building efficiency, and improvements to energy
efficiency should be concentrated on those households at risk of fuel poverty.
At the same time there needs to be a scaling-up of support services to
vulnerable people and greater integration with health and social care.

**Key indicator**: % of households in fuel poverty
