title: Further funding successes

We are pleased to announce two further funding successes that will support us
in delivering phase three of the project this winter.

We were awarded £5,000 by the Megawatt Community Energy Fund. The fund was
setup to distribute profits of the [Bristol Energy
Cooperative](http://www.bristolenergy.coop) and is manageed by the [Quartet
Community
Foundation](http://quartetcf.org.uk/grant-programmes/megawatt-community-energy-large-and-small-grants/).
It was a very competative round, with many fantastic organisations, so we are very
pleased to have received the money and the recognition and support of the wider
community. See [here](http://quartetcf.org.uk/report/grants-awarded/) for a full list of the grants awarded.

We also recieved a £1,000 grant from [The Naturesave
Trust](http://www.naturesave.co.uk/the-naturesave-trust/) to purchase new
equipment. The Naturesave Trust is an organisation that
funds environmental, conservation and community renewable-energy projects
throughout the UK.
