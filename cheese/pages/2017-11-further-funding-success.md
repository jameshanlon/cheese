title: Further funding successes

We are pleased to announce two further funding successes that will support us
in delivering phase three of the project this winter.

We were awarded £5,000 by the Megawatt Community Energy Fund. The fund was
setup to distribute profits of the [Bristol Energy
Cooperative](http://www.bristolenergy.coop) and is managed by the [Quartet
Community
Foundation](http://quartetcf.org.uk/grant-programmes/megawatt-community-energy-large-and-small-grants/).
It was a very competitive round, with many fantastic organisations, so we are
very pleased to have received the money and the recognition and support of the
wider community. See

grants awarded.

We also received a £1,000 grant from [The Naturesave
Trust](http://www.naturesave.co.uk/the-naturesave-trust/) to purchase new
equipment. The Naturesave Trust is an organisation that
funds environmental, conservation and community renewable-energy projects
throughout the UK.
