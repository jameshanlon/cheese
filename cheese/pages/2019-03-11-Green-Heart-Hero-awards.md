On Monday 11th March we attended the Climate Coalition's [Green Heart Hero
Award](https://www.theclimatecoalition.org/greenhearthero), for which we were
nominated for the most inspirational community project. Although we didn't win,
we had a fun evening. Congratulations to [Transition Town
Wellington](http://ttw.org.uk/) for winning in the category, and to the other
[nominees and winners](https://www.theclimatecoalition.org/greenhearthero) of
the evening.
