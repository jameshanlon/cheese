We are delighted to report that we won an award at this year's *Voscurs* social
impact awards! The award was for 'Environmental Impact', as voted for by the
public, and was presented by the head of the Avon Wildlife Trust.
Congratulations are due to all of the the team for your help in making The
C.H.E.E.S.E. Project such a success.
