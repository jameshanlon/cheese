## 1. Statement of policy and purpose of policy

* The C.H.E.E.S.E. Project CIC (the Employer) is committed to equal
   opportunities for all staff and applicants.

* It is our policy that all employment decisions are based on merit and the
  legitimate business needs of the organisation. The Employer does not
  discriminate on the basis of race, colour or nationality, ethnic or national
  origins, sex, gender reassignment, sexual orientation, marital or civil partner
  status, pregnancy or maternity, disability, religion or belief, age or any
  other ground on which it is or becomes unlawful to discriminate under the laws
  of England and Wales (referred to as **Protected Characteristics**).

* Our intention is to enable all our staff to work in an environment which
  allows them to fulfil their potential without fear of discrimination,
  harassment or victimisation. The Employer's commitment to equal opportunities
  extends to all aspects of the working relationship including:

  - recruitment and selection procedures;
  - terms of employment, including pay, conditions and benefits;
  - training, appraisals, career development and promotion;
  - work practices, conduct issues, allocation of tasks, discipline and grievances;
  - work-related social events; and
  - termination of employment and matters after termination, including references.

* This policy is intended to help the Employer achieve its diversity and
  anti-discrimination aims by clarifying the responsibilities and duties of
  all staff in respect of equal opportunities and discrimination.

* The principles of non-discrimination and equal opportunities also apply to
  the way in which staff treat visitors, clients, customers, suppliers and
  former staff members.

* This is a statement of policy only and does not form part of your contract
  of employment. This policy may be amended at any time by the Employer, in
  its absolute discretion.

<a class="anchor" name="responsibility"></a>
## 2. Who is responsible for equal opportunities?

* Achieving an equal opportunities workplace is a collective task shared
  between the Employer and all its staff. This policy and the rules contained
  in it therefore apply to all staff of the Employer irrespective of seniority,
  tenure and working hours, including all employees, directors and officers,
  consultants and contractors, casual or agency staff, trainees, homeworkers and
  fixed-term staff and any volunteers or interns (referred to as Staff).

* The board of directors of the Employer has overall responsibility for this
  policy and for equal opportunities and discrimination law compliance in the
  workplace and the The Survey Manager has been appointed as the person with
  day-to-day operational responsibility for these matters.

* All Staff have personal responsibility to ensure compliance with this
  policy, to treat colleagues with dignity at all times and not to
  discriminate against or harass other members of Staff, visitors, clients,
  customers, suppliers and former staff members. In addition, Staff who take part
  in management, recruitment, selection, promotion, training and other aspects of
  career development (referred to as Managers) have special responsibility for
  leading by example and ensuring compliance.

* Managers must take all necessary steps to:

    - promote the objective of equal opportunities and the values set out in
      this policy;
    - ensure that their own behaviour and those of the Staff they manage
      complies in full with this policy;
    - ensure that any complaints of discrimination, victimisation or harassment
      (including against themselves) are dealt with appropriately and are not
      suppressed or disregarded.

<a class="anchor" name="discrimination"></a>
## 3. What is discrimination?

* Discrimination occurs in different ways, some more obvious than others.
  Discrimination on the grounds of any of the Protected Characteristics is
  prohibited by law, even if unintentional, unless a particular exception
  applies.

### Direct discrimination

* Direct Discrimination is less favourable treatment because of one of the
  Protected Characteristics. Examples would include refusing a woman a job as
  a chauffeur because you believe that women are not good drivers or restricting
  recruitment to persons under 40 because you want to have a young and dynamic
  workforce.

* Direct discrimination can arise in some cases even though the person
  complaining does not actually possess the Protected Characteristic but is
  perceived to have it or associates with other people who do. For example, when
  a person is less favourably treated because they are (wrongly) believed to be
  homosexual or because they have a spouse who is Muslim. Indirect discrimination

* Indirect discrimination arises when an employer applies an apparently
  neutral provision, criterion or practice which in fact puts individuals
  with a particular Protected Characteristic at a disadvantage, statistically and
  this is unjustified. To show discrimination the individual complaining also has
  to be personally disadvantaged. An example would be a requirement for job
  candidates to have ten years' experience in a particular role, since this will
  be harder for young people to satisfy. This kind of discrimination is unlawful
  unless it is a proportionate means of achieving a legitimate aim.

### Victimisation

* Victimisation means treating a person less favourably because they have
  made a complaint of discrimination or have provided information in
  connection with a complaint or because they might do one of these things.

### Harassment

* Harassment is:

    - unwanted conduct which is related to a Protected Characteristic and which has
      the purpose or effect of violating a person's dignity or creating an
      intimidating, hostile, degrading, humiliating or offensive environment for
      them: or
    - unwanted conduct which is of a sexual nature and which has the purpose or
      effect of violating a person's dignity or creating an intimidating, hostile,
      degrading, humiliating or offensive environment for them (Sexual Harassment);
      or
    - less favourable treatment because of the rejection of or the submission to
      Sexual Harassment.

* Harassment can arise in some cases even though the person complaining does
  not actually possess a Protected Characteristic but is perceived to have it
  (for example, when a person is harassed because they are (wrongly believed to
  be homosexual) or associates with other people who possess a Protected
  Characteristic (for example, because they have a spouse who is Muslim).

* Harassment may include:

    - use of insults or slurs based on a Protected Characteristic or of a sexual
      nature or other verbal abuse or derogatory, offensive or stereotyping jokes
      or remarks;
    - physical or verbal abuse, threatening or intimidating behaviour because of a
      Protected Characteristic or behaviour of a sexual nature;
    - unwelcome physical contact including touching, hugging, kissing, pinching or
      patting, brushing past, invading personal space, pushing grabbing or other
      assaults;
    - mocking, mimicking or belittling a person's disability, appearance, accent or
      other personal characteristics;
    - unwelcome requests for sexual acts or favours; verbal sexual advances,
      vulgar, sexual, suggestive or explicit comments or behaviour;
    - repeated requests, either explicitly or implicitly, for dates;
    - repeated requests for social contact or after it has been made clear that
      requests are unwelcome;
    - comments about body parts or sexual preference;
    - displaying or distributing offensive or explicit pictures, items or materials
      relating to a Protected Characteristic or of a sexual nature;
    - shunning or ostracising someone, for example, by deliberately excluding them
      from conversations or activities;
    - 'outing' or threatening to 'out' someone's sexual orientation (ie to make it known);
    - explicit or implicit suggestions that employment status or progression is
      related to toleration of, or acquiescence to sexual advances, or other
      behaviour amounting to harassment.

* Other important points to note about harassment:

    - a single incident can amount to harassment;
    - behaviour that has continued for a long period without complaint can amount
      to harassment;
    - it is not necessary for an individual to intend to harass someone for their
      behaviour to amount to harassment;
    - it is not necessarily for an individual to communicate that behaviour is
      unwelcome before it amounts to harassment; and
    - the onus is on each individual to be certain that their behaviour and conduct
      is appropriate and is not unwanted and in the case of doubt, you must refrain
      from such conduct. Disability discrimination

* This could be direct or indirect discrimination, and is any unjustified
  less favourable treatment because of the effects of a disability, and
  failure to make reasonable adjustments to alleviate disadvantages caused by a
  disability.

<a class="anchor" name="disabled-persons"></a>
## 4. Disabled persons

* Any Staff member who considers that they may have a disability is strongly
  encouraged to speak with the The Survey Manager, particularly if they
  experience difficulties at work because of their disability so that any
  reasonable adjustments to help overcome or minimise difficulties can be
  discussed. For these purposes, disability includes any physical or mental
  impairment which substantially affects your ability to perform day to day
  activities and has lasted (or is likely to last) more than 12 months.
  Disclosure of this information will be treated in confidence, if you wish it to
  be, so far as is reasonably practicable and we will do our best to handle
  matters sensitively and to ensure that you are treated with dignity and with
  respect for your privacy.

* We will consult with you about whether adjustments are needed to avoid you
  being disadvantaged and may ask you to see a doctor appointed by us, to
  advise on this. We will seek to accommodate your needs within reason. If we
  consider a particular adjustment unreasonable we will explain why and try to
  find an alternative solution.

* Managers with responsibility for managing a member of Staff who they know
  or think to be disabled should speak to the The Survey Manager to ensure
  that all relevant duties are complied with. Making employment decisions fairly

* As noted above, the Employer will recruit employees and make other
  employment decisions concerning promotion, training, dismissal and related
  issues. on the basis of objective criteria.

* Managers should only stipulate criteria or conditions for employment
  decisions (including job selection, promotion and redundancy) which are
  based on a legitimate business need and which do not go further than is needed
  to satisfy that need. If you are in any doubt about whether particular criteria
  or conditions are indirectly discriminatory or justifiable, then please speak
  to the The Survey Manager.

<a class="anchor" name="recruitment"></a>
## 5. Recruitment

* Managers involved in recruitment must:

    - specify only recruitment criteria that are relevant to the job, reflect
      genuine business needs and are proportionate. More than one person should be
      involved in shortlisting of applicants wherever practicable;
    - ensure that vacancies are advertised to a diverse audience and try to avoid
      informal recruitment methods that exclude fair competition. In very rare cases,
      it may be legitimate and necessary to restrict recruitment to a particular role
      to certain groups, but it is essential that this is discussed with the The
      Survey Manager so that appropriate steps can be taken to ensure legality;
    - review job advertisements carefully to ensure that stereotyping is avoided
      and that particular groups are not unjustifiably discouraged from applying;
    - not ask applicants about health or disability before a job offer is made
      (other than in exceptional circumstances and after having been approved by the
      The Survey Manager). If necessary a job offer can be expressed to be
      conditional upon satisfactorily passing a medical check.
    - not ask candidates about any Protected Characteristic if the question may
      demonstrate an intention to discriminate. For example, candidates should not be
      asked about current or future pregnancy, childcare or related matters; and
    - not make assumptions about immigration status based on appearance, accent or
      apparent nationality;
    - so far as reasonably practicable, keep a written record of their reasons for
      relevant decisions.

* The Employer is legally required to verify that all employees have the
  right to work in the UK. Prior to starting employment, all employees must
  produce original documents to the Employer's satisfaction, irrespective of
  nationality. Information about the documents required is available from the
  Managing Director.

* Training needs may be identified during the normal appraisal process.
  Appropriate training to facilitate progression will be accessible to all
  staff.

* All promotion decisions will be made on the basis of merit and according to
  proportionate criteria determined by legitimate business need.

* Access to benefits and facilities and terms of employment will be kept
  under review to ensure that they are appropriately structured and that no
  unlawful barriers to qualification or access exist.

<a class="anchor" name="discipline"></a>
## 6. Discipline and termination of employment

* Any redundancy selection criteria and procedures that are used, or other
  decisions taken to terminate employment, will be fair and not directly or
  indirectly discriminatory.

* Disciplinary procedures and penalties will be applied without
  discrimination, whether they result in disciplinary warnings, dismissal or
  other disciplinary action.

* Part-time and fixed-term staff will be treated the same as full-time or
  permanent staff of the same position and enjoy no less favourable terms and
  conditions (pro-rata, where appropriate), unless different treatment is
  justified.

<a class="anchor" name="encountering-discrimination"></a>
## 7. What to do if you encounter discrimination

* If you believe that you have been the victim of discrimination, you should
  follow the Employer's Grievance Procedure.

* Every member of Staff has a responsibility to combat discrimination if they
  encounter it. Staff who observe or are aware of acts that they believe
  amount to discrimination directed at others are encouraged to report these to
  the The Survey Manager.

* Any grievance or report raised about discrimination will be kept
  confidential so far as this is practicable. We may ask you if you wish your
  complaint(s) to be put to the alleged discriminator if disciplinary action
  appears to be appropriate. It sometimes may be necessary to disclose the
  complaint or take action even if this is not in line with your wishes, but we
  will seek to protect you from victimisation and, if you wish, we will seek to
  protect your identity. You should be aware that disciplinary action may be
  impossible without your co-operation or if you refuse to allow relevant
  information to be disclosed.

* Staff who raise a complaint about or report discrimination in good faith
  will be protected from retaliation or victimisation. As long as you act in
  good faith, the fact that you have raised a complaint or report will not affect
  your position within the Employer, even if the complaint is not upheld. Making
  a false allegation deliberately and in bad faith is a misconduct offence and
  will be dealt with in accordance with our disciplinary policy. Any member of
  Staff who attempts acts of retaliation or victimisation may be subject to
  disciplinary action up to and including summary dismissal for gross misconduct.

* If you make a complaint, it may be necessary to ask you to stay at home on
  paid leave while investigations are being conducted and the matter is being
  dealt with through the appropriate procedure. This may particularly be
  necessary in cases of alleged harassment.

<a class="anchor" name="non-compliance"></a>
## 8. Non-compliance with equal opportunities rules

* Any breach of equal opportunities rules or failure to comply with this
  policy will be taken very seriously and is likely to result in disciplinary
  action against the offender, up to and including immediate dismissal.

* Staff should also note that:

    - in some cases, they may be personally liable for their acts of
      discrimination and that legal action may be taken against them directly
      by the victim of any discrimination; and
    - it may be a criminal offence intentionally to harass another employee.

<a class="anchor" name="review"></a>
## 9. Review of this policy

* The board of directors of the Employer will keep this policy under review.

* The Employer encourages Staff to comment on this policy and suggest ways in
  which it might be improved or ask any questions if they are unsure about
  any part of this policy or how it is applied by contacting the The Survey
  Manager.
