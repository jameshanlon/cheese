title: Complaints procedure

# Complaints procedure

The C.H.E.E.S.E. Project aims to provide an excellent service of a standard
acceptable to all our customers, partners and team members. If we fail to do
this we want to know about it. This will enable us not only to deal with the
specific problem, but also avoid it happening again. Since The C.H.E.E.S.E.
Project started operating in 2015 we have not received any complaints.

Our complaints procedure sets out how individuals can take up matters about the
service they have received from us where they believe it has been
unsatisfactory.

1. If you have a complaint to make, it should be made to the Managing
   Director\*  immediately who will try to resolve the issue informally. 

2. If the issue is serious, or you are not satisfied after raising it with the
   Managing Director, you should make a formal complaint.

3. Your complaint should be made in writing, marked “Private & Confidential",
   and sent to the Managing Director who will acknowledge it in writing
   (normally within 7 days of receipt). Remember to keep a copy of your letter. If
   you need an interpreter or advocate to help you make your complaint, The
   C.H.E.E.S.E. Project can arrange this for you.

4. The Managing Director shall - in consultation with the Board of Directors -
   investigate the complaint. 

5. The Managing Director shall communicate the results of the investigation to
   you within a reasonable time - normally 21 days.

6. Escalation: You have the right - if dissatisfied with the results of the
   inquiry - to put your case in writing or personally to a panel comprising at
   least three members from The C.H.E.E.S.E Project Management Committee. If
   attending personally, you have the right to be accompanied by a friend or
   advocate to help put your case. (The panel also has the right to have an
   adviser present).

7. The decision of the panel will be final.

8. Where appropriate, The C.H.E.E.S.E. Project will make a written apology to
   the complainant, and agree any further action necessary to make good the
   cause of the complaint.

9. All formal complaints and the response made to them will be recorded and
   filed in a secure place.

10. The Management Committee shall be informed by the Managing Director at the
    first available meeting of the number and nature of any formal complaints
    and their outcome, and consideration will be given to the implications these
    have for the planning and management of future services, as part of The
    C.H.E.E.S.E. Project’s self-evaluation.

\* If a complaint relates to the Managing Director, read ‘other nominated
member of the Management Committee’ for ‘Managing Director’ throughout this
policy.
