Nikki Jones, a researcher, writer and journalist on oil, gas and energy will
give a series of 6 free talks in Redland every Tuesday from 5th March to April
9th at 7.30 pm. They are fully updated from [previous
years](http://www.bristolenergy.coop/resources-nikkijones.html). The venue is
the Mustard Room at the [Kensington Arms](https://thekensingtonarms.co.uk/) in
Redland.

The atmosphere is relaxed and each lecture is self contained. The event in the
series is a discussion to draws together the threads of previous talks and
points to what we as individuals can do. It is easy to go away from climate
change meetings with a feeling of helplessness at the task ahead.
