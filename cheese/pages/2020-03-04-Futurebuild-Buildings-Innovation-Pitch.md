We are delighted to report that last Wednesday (4th March) at the huge and
prestigious building industry event
[Futurebuild](https://www.futurebuild.co.uk/) at ExCeL, London, The
C.H.E.E.S.E. Project won the [Big Innovation Pitch
award](https://www.futurebuild.co.uk/whats-on/big-innovation-pitch-shortlist)
for Buildings, one of Futurebuild's six challenges, described as "Buildings:
retrofitted, re-used, net positive and built to perform". The pitch was given
by our thermal-imaging expert Brian Harper.

This award is valuable recognition in the industry, and particularly amongst
organisations like BEIS and BRE, for our project's unique value as the low-cost
front end of retrofitting. As now more than 3,000 retrofits a day are needed
for the government to meet its 2050 climate target, the need for innovative
approaches like ours is clearer than ever.

Here is what Futurebuild says about itself:

> "Futurebuild is the built environment event that unites the most
> forward-thinking companies and organisations with industry mobilisers who
> hold significant decision-making power and are committed to driving positive
> change in their sector, and beyond...
>
> As the industry’s catalyst for change, Futurebuild fosters collaboration,
> knowledge-sharing and innovation to enable the industry to do things
> differently."

And about the Big Innovation Pitches:

> Hosted across Futurebuild in conjunction with BRE as technical partner the
> competition will be the industry’s largest call-out for innovation to date
> and will identify and celebrate novel new approaches to some of the biggest
> challenges facing us all.
