title: CHEESE featured in Hong Kong documentary

The CHEESE Project was recenlty approached by Radio Television Hong Kong
(RTHK), the public broadcaster of Hong Kong. They were researching the
potential for carbon reductions through energy-efficiency measures implemented
in the home and wanted to find out more about our approach. They came and
visited us in May and the documentary is now [available to watch
online](http://podcast.rthk.hk/podcast/item_epi.php?pid=1045&lang=en-US).
The part featuring CHEESE is in part two, at around 11 minutes and 36 seconds
in.
