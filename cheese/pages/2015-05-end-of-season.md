We have now completed our fourth winter surveying season, and are pleased to
report this has been our best season yet! Overall, we delivered 115 surveys, up
26% from last year. Of this total, 18 surveys were performed for free to
low-income households, and 23 surveys were performed by our partner
organisations: Bristol Green Doors, Innovate UK, Dhek Bhal and Golder Agers.
The map below shows how these surveys were spread our over the city. A huge
thanks is due to our survey manager Maddy Longhurst for orchestrating the whole
operation, to all our Energy Tracers for delivering the surveys, and to the
CHEESE management team for all the work behind the scenes.
