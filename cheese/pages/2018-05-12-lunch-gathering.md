title: CHEESE lunchtime gathering to celebrate a successful survey season
gallery: 2018-05-lunch-gathering

This survey season was our most successful with 91 surveys delivered. It
is a considerable body of work and indeed should make a substantial difference
to energy consumption and also to people's lives. 

To celebrate and reflect on this achievement, the CHEESE team got together for
lunch at Mike Andrew's house (see photos below). This was an opportunity to
debrief with each other, to discuss what went well and what could be improved
next year, and a chance to share in the future of the project.

Thanks again to everyone who contributed to the project's success!
