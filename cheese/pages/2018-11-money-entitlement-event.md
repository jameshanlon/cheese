This was a free event, hosted by Karin Smyth MP on November 30th at The
Gatehouse, Hareclive Road. It aimed to offer people a better understanding of
the financial help they may be eligible to receive, by providing an opportunity
find out more about univeral credit, pensions, tax credits and so on. As the
weather gets colder, there will also be information about keeping warm and
saving energy, which is why we were there.
