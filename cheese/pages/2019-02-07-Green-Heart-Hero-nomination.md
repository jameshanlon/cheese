We are thrilled to have been nominated for the Climate Coalition's [Green Heart
Hero Award](https://www.theclimatecoalition.org/greenhearthero).

> Green hearts reflect the belief in the possibility of a cleaner, safer
> future; the ambition and efforts of projects big and small that are
> transforming communities everywhere; and the force of millions who are
> protecting the things they love. The Green Heart Hero Awards are a chance to
> celebrate these extraordinary endeavours and give our neighbours a huge round
> of applause for all they are doing to create a cleaner, more secure future
> for our communities and beyond.

The award is to be presented by Clive Anderson, TV and Radio presenter, and Kay
Burley, Sky TV news presenter, at the House of Commons on 11th March.

Fingers crossed! And a huge thanks to whoever nominated us.
