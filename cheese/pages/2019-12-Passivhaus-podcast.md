We are delighted that CHEESE was mentioned on 'Passivhaus: The Energy
Efficiency Podcast'. We were described in the context of a discussion of the
promotion of energy-efficiency habits, products and information.

What they said: The magnificently named ‘CHEESE Project’ is doing something
different from many community projects. It conducts thermal imaging of a home
from low cost to no cost, depending on a households circumstances. A clear
understanding of a building’s thermal performance is essential so that works to
a home are focused in the right and most cost effective places. CHEESE’s work
typically shows poorly-fitted windows, missing insulation and draughts between
floorboards, all of which can make a home feel quite uncomfortable in cold
weather.
