We recently conducted a thermal-imaging surveys in Bristol Zoo Garden’s Reptile
House, paid for by the zoo’s energy provider [Bristol
Energy](https://www.bristol-energy.co.uk). The survey will help Bristol Zoo
Gardens, which is operated by conservation and education charity Bristol
Zoological Society, to reduce their energy consumption, cut their carbon
emissions and save money.

Elinor Kershaw, Sustainability and Projects Co-ordinator at Bristol Zoo
Gardens, said: 

> We have learnt a lot about how the building works which we could never have
> seen from looking at the equipment and the energy bills alone. It was also
> fascinating to see the animal enclosures and some of the animals through
> thermal imaging. The videos taken during the survey will be reviewed to
> prepare an internal report on the building. We also plan to share the results
> and information on the heat-mapping process with our Green Team and wider
> staff.
