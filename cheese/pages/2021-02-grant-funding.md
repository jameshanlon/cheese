We are delighted to be able to report that The C.H.E.E.S.E. Project has just
been awarded a substantial grant to permit expansion of the project and the
establishing of a new company to social-franchise the Energy Tracers survey
system. The details of the grant and funder are at present confidential, but
will be disclosed in due course.

The grant has been awarded for C.H.E.E.S.E. to develop until it is financially
sustainable without further grants, thus to become a model franchisee. The new
parent company will be for profit and limited by shares but its will be operated
firmly as a social enterprise with charitable aims. To make this concrete, we
aim to make it a [B-Corporation](https://bcorporation.uk/) (analagous to Fair Trade).

On establishing the new company, and provided we hit certain milestones by the
end of June, our funders will provide further substantial funding over three
years to develop the parent company and its franchising model. By then we
anticipate that several replica franchisees will be operating and that we will
be able to raise investment for further expansion.

The grants will be sufficient to employ:

- A full-time office administrator/assistant (to help Mike) - from early April.
- 0.8 FTE General Manger with experience of franchising - from May.
- 0.4 FTE CHEESE Survey Manager - from June.

These posts will be advertised shortly.

In the meantime, during lockdown, the Board have been busy developing the
business model, including a new Heatview camera, blower door, on-line survey
management system and revised training course.

Thanks to the help of our members, staff, volunteers and friends, our success
together has led to this wonderful opportunity. Together we can look forward to
making a real difference to carbon emissions and fuel poverty. The potential
for expansion is enormous if we can get it right. 

At present, we hope to be carrying out a few surveys on empty properties during
the next few months. We hope that it will be possible to train more Energy
Tracers in October, and start surveying in the Autumn - this will depend on
government regulations, and our own precautions for Covid.
