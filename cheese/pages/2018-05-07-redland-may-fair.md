We had a fantastic day at [Redland May Fair](https://rcas.org.uk/may-fair/) on
the first May bank holiday weekend, which was bathed in sunshine and extremely
hot. Although the weather was not ideal to people about their cold homes, we
had a busy day with lots of people interested in the project and in organising
surveys next winter. Note the cheese 'bait' in the photos!
