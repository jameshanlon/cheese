title: Redland May Fair

We had a fantastic day at [Redland May Fair](https://rcas.org.uk/may-fair/) on
the first May bank holiday weekend, which was bathed in sunshine. Although the
weather was not ideal to people about their cold homes, we had lots of
interest in the project and for surveys next winter.
