# Customer's survey testimonials

On this page, we've collected some representative feedback from customers who've had
a internal home survey.

## From the 2016/17 surveying season (phase 2)

- *"A really valuable service, represented excellent value for money. The friendly,
  very helpful surveyors suggested simple remedies that will make a big, positive
  impact on the warmth of our house. A massive thank you to all involved."*

- *"I just wanted to say how BRILLIANT the Cheese Survey experience was!"*

- *"Jamie and Boycee made a fantastic team - they were polite, great at listening,
  helpful and interesting in a perfect balance."*

- *"I got so much out of it. I have already started sealing gaps and stuffing holes
  under skirting boards - I swear its warmer already! I think it might be a bit
  addictive ....funny there are little holes everywhere I never saw before!
  Please pass on my thanks to them - it was inspiring. I will spread the word."*

- *"It was really excellent and revelatory!"*

- *"The energy tracers were very professional and polite. The memory stick is very
  useful to keep looking back on and checking what happened on the day and being
  able to refer back to as you don't take everything in at the time. The cheese
  box gave me some good information and lots of practical advice in the book."*

- *"Excellent. I am stunned that I had never thought about how big an effect
  draughts could have on heat loss."*

- *"Many more thanks for the visit that you and Salvador made and all advice given.
  I found the survey incredibly informative and your suggestions for simple,
  easily applied improvements were exactly what I wanted and need!"*

- The householder gave the survey *"10/10"* and that if it hadn't been done she
  *"wouldn't know where the money is going"*.

- *"I thought the whole organisation of the survey was well done, and the Energy
  Tracers efficient and friendly. I particularly appreciated the opportunity to
  see what was being discovered on the tablet as it was happening."*

- *"The survey was well worth the money and very interesting. – It was fun!"*

- *Very good to see heat loss with tenants, which helped raise energy awareness
  with tenants, which was an important aspect for [our Housing Association].*

- Although the householder was initially sceptical about the value of the survey,
  they commented that it *"added loads - things never seen before and the amount
  of time the surveyors spent meant it represented good value and would recommend
  it to others.*

- *"I'm so happy with what you did, you should do it to everyone, especially when
  people are buying houses"*. The experience of seeing the thermal images was
  *"mind boggling"*, *"it says it all"*, *"it opens your eyes to everything"*. 
  The householder has lived in the house for 15 years but didn't understand/know
  about any of the faults until he had the survey. He has now
  sent the CHEESE survey video to send to the council as evidence of the issues
he has. He said that CHEESE surveys should be extended to survey all houses in Bristol!

- *"Really happy the survey happened. The video is great, with lots of practical/DIY 
  tips rather than just recommendations for contractors to do improvements."*

- *"Great and incredibly cheap."* He thought the survey was *"Phenomenal"*. It was
  recommended to him and he would recommend it to others.

- *"Perfect really. the two guys that came were brilliant and very helpful."*

- *"The most striking aspect of the survey for me was the focus on cold draughts,
  which is probably not what most people first think of, but is also probably
  easiest to do something about."*

- *"I think this is a particularly positive message as the kind of things that
  usually come to mind are big and potentially daunting projects like getting
  double glazing or insulation of some kind."*

- *"Energy Tracers marvellous and professional. Result of survey interesting. lots
  of small niggles to solve."*

- *"Can't thank you enough for your time and efforts. Very friendly, professional
  and courteous tracers. Providing a great service to minimise wasted energy and
  improve home warmth."*

- *"Surveyors were absolutely lovely. Survey was great. Overall really
  grateful and enjoyed the survey"*.

## From the 2015/16 surveying season (phase 1)

- From someone who struggled to heat her home to a comfortable temperature:
  *"A real eye-opener. Excellent! I found I could do everything for
  about £150 and got to work straight away."*

- *"There were still places where draughts were coming in and heat
  leaking out that I would never have thought of."*

- *"We were very pleased with the results of the survey and found the process
  very interesting.  We have found the results of the electricity smart reader
  useful too and I'm much more conscious now about turning off lights, sockets
  etc!"*

- *“Measures [sealing round skirting boards in kitchen and lounge, blocking
  chimney draught, lagging pipes in cellar] have reduced monthly electricity bill
  by £15.”*

- From two people who had already made some insulation improvements: *"Thank
  you very much for laying on Brian, Dave and Matt today. Very instructive, some
  draught proofing and the like to work on but generally very encouraging for
  us."*
