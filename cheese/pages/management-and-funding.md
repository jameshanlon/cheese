# Management and organisation

The CHEESE Project was setup in 2015, Bristol's Green Capital year, by a small
group of local people concerned about climate change and who wanted to make
Bristol a truly sustainable city. It was formally founded as an unincorporated
association in August 2016, governed by a five-member volunteer management
committee working to a
[formal constisution (PDF)]({{url_for('.assets', filename='files/CHEESE-Constitution-2016-08-17.pdf')}}).
In February 2018, the CHEESE Project was granted Community Interest Company (CIC)
status. For more information on the structure and organisation of the CHEESE Project,
please read our
[articles of association (PDF)]({{url_for('.assets', filename='files/CHEESE-CIC-articles-of-association-2018-03-09.pdf')}}).

The project is organised by a *central office* and operates through
*community segments* and *city partners* who carry out the internal and
external surveys. Community segments are partner associations based in Bristol
city wards and city partners replicate the CHEESE Project, in coordination with
Bristol, in other cities (more details on [who we work with here](/partners)).

Our central office management team consists of six people:

- Michael Alford Andrews, Managing Director;
- Jeremy Birch, Technical Manager;
- David Tudgey, Community and Development Manager;
- Brian Harper, Director;
- James Hanlon, Director;
- Susan Nicholls, Director.
