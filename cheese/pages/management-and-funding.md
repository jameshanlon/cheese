# Management and organisation

The CHEESE Project was setup in 2015, Bristol's Green Capital year, by a
small group of local people concerned about climate change and who wanted to
make Bristol a truly sustainable city.

The Project is organised by a *central office* but it operates through
*community segments* and *city partners* who carry out the internal
and external surveys. Community segments are partner associations based in
Bristol city wards and city partners replicate the CHEESE Project, in
coordination with Bristol, in other cities.

We currently have three community segments in Bristol:

- [Ambition Lawrence Weston](http://www.ambitionlw.org)
- [Easton Energy Group](http://www.eastonenergygroup.org)
- [Bishopston, Cotham, Redland Energy Group](https://www.facebook.com/BCR.EnergyGroup)

Our central office management team consists of six people:

- Michael Alford Andrews, General manager.
- Jeremy Birch, Technical manager.
- David Tudgey, Community and development manager.
- James Hanlon.
- Susan Nicholls.
