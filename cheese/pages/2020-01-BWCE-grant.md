We have been awarded Â£4,500 from the [Bath and West Community Energy](#BWCE)
(BWCE) Trust Fund to setup a C.H.E.E.S.E. replica in Bath. BWCE are the UK's
second largest energy and community cooperative. 

The funding will pay for the training of Energy Tracer (ET) surveyors, to
conduct Heatview thermal surveys of the interior of homes, to our Continuing
Professional Development (CPD) standard. Once qualified, these ETs will be able
to survey private homes, and homes leased by both private and social landlords.
They will be assisted by locally recruited volunteers (some being students) and
will be supplied with our unique combination of equipment and bespoke Heatview
software. Surveys will be managed from Bristol for this pilot.
