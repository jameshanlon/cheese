We have unfortunately had to closed our survey season early this year to help
slow the spread of Covid-19, but we have none the less had a very successful
5th season. Thanks to our amazing team of Energy Tracers, so committed to
raising awareness and enabling real action on climate breakdown and fuel
poverty, and our wonderful volunteer assistants, keen to learn and generous
with their time.

This season we have been thrilled and honoured to win the [Big Innovation pitch
Award for Buildings](2020-03-04-Futurebuild-Buildings-Innovation-Pitch) at the
prestigious Futurebuild industry event, and the [award for Environmental Impact
at the ‘Voscurs’](2020-02-Voscur-awards) Bristol’s social impact awards. This
gives our approach and effort well deserved recognition and validation as we
move confidently forward. We were also excited to be featured on BBC Radio 4’s
[Costing the Earth](2020-03-Costing-the-Earth) expose of the poor quality of
new build homes in the UK, ‘Eco Homes now! in March.

We regularly receive requests from other parts of the country wanting to have a
C.H.E.E.S.E Project in their area. We want to be able to respond to this
accelerating demand and are progressing the prototype of our next generation
low-cost thermal camera and developing ideas, training and partnerships for
expansion, something we can focus on over the summer.

We look forward to getting going again with next seasons's surveys in November
and wish you all good health and strong community in these challenging times of
change.
