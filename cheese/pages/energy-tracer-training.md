<div class="lead">We are looking for enthusiastic people to train to become
CHEESE Energy Tracers.</div>

Licensed Energy Tracers conduct [thermal-imaging surveys of domestic
buildings](/home-surveys) to identify areas of poor thermal efficiency. They
also provide the householder with information on how to tackle any of the
issues identified and other general ways of saving energy in their home.

As an Energy Tracer, you will learn how to operate the CHEESE thermal
imaging equipment, how to interpret thermal images and the basics of building
construction and energy efficiency. As well as this, you will have the
opportunity to meet new and interesting people, to make a significant
contribution to an exciting and important project, to gain expertise that might
help in your career advancement and to earn some extra money.  Since training
and surveys will be done outside of normal working hours, being an Energy
Tracer can be fitted around a full-time job.

To train to become an Energy Tracer, you will first need to attend our training
course to learn the basics of thermal imaging and building construction, led by
thermal imaging expert Brian Harper. After that, you will work with a trained
Energy Tracer and shadow them as they perform house surveys to gain experience
and confidence. To become fully-fledged, you will need to pass a short
practical exam, but you will then be eligible for payment and be able to lead
surveys, mostly during evenings and weekends, and train new aspiring Energy
Tracers.

We are now looking for people to train to start surveying next season,
between November 2017 and March 2018.

If you are excited by the idea of becoming involved with the CHEESE Project
to train as an Energy Tracer, then please get in touch by emailing

introduce yourself.
