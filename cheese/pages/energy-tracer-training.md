<div class="lead">We are looking for enthusiastic people to train to become
CHEESE Energy Tracers.</div>

Licensed Energy Tracers conduct [thermal-imaging surveys of domestic
buildings](/home-surveys) to identify areas of poor thermal efficiency. They
also provide the householder with information on how to tackle any of the
issues identified and other general ways of saving energy in their home.

As an Energy Tracer, you will learn how to operate the CHEESE thermal
imaging equipment, how to interpret thermal images and the basics of building
construction and energy efficiency. As well as this, you will have the
opportunity to meet new and interesting people, to make a significant
contribution to an exciting and important project, to gain expertise that might
help in your career advancement and to earn some extra money.  Since training
and surveys will be done outside of normal working hours, being an Energy
Tracer can be fitted around a full-time job.

## Training

To train to become an Energy Tracer, you will need to attend our two-day
training course to learn the basics of thermal imaging and building
construction, led by thermal-imaging expert Brian Harper. We also run a
half-day course on the health and safety aspects of working in people's homes.
We normally hold these courses in October and November, before the start of the
surveying season.

The two-day course has classroom-based and practical parts, with plenty of time
for questions and discussion. Nick Banks, a participant of the training course,
held over the weekend of 21st, 22nd October 2017 said:

> trainees. [...] I look forward to the follow up sessions and, in the

You will gain experience of CHEESE thermal imaging surveys by assisting a
trained Energy Tracer and shadow them as they perform house surveys. If you
have undertaken the training courses, it is possible to become a fully-fledged
Energy Tracer in the same season. The final step to completing the training is
for Brian Harper to assess a survey led by you, to check you are confident and
capable of delivering surveys to the public. After this, you will be eligible
for payment and be able to lead surveys, and help train new aspiring Energy
Tracers.

If you were not able to complete the training courses, you can assist with
surveys but will need to wait to complete the next training course to complete
the training. We also welcome anyone who would like to assist with surveys but
do not plan to complete the Energy Tracer training.

## Scheduling of surveys

The surveying season will start in November and surveys are usually scheduled
at the weekends, but sometimes on weekday evenings, in sets of 2 or 3 in a day.
They will be in in the greater Bristol area.

## Get in touch

If you are excited by the idea of becoming involved with the CHEESE Project to
train as an Energy Tracer, then please get in touch by emailing
[info@cheeseproject.co.uk](mailto:info@cheeseproject.co.uk) to introduce
yourself.

Please note that since our surveys involve meeting members of the public and
visiting their homes, we will need you to supply us with a short CV and two
short character references. This is part of our operations policy and we ask
all new surveyors to do so. The references can be from friends or employers but
need to be a written paragraph or two, not just a telephone number.
