This year's [Redland May Fair](http://www.rcas.org.uk/redland-fair) was hugely
successful and attracted large crowds on a beautiful sunny day. We spoke to
lots of people about the warmth of their homes, retrofit and the value of
having a CHEESE thermal imaging survey. That was until the heavens opened and
we all got very wet. Thank you to Bristol Energy Network who kindly lent us
their new gazeebo.
