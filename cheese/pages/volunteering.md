# Volunteering with CHEESE

The CHEESE Project operates on a very small budget and depends on the work of
volunteers for its continued organisation and management. If you are interested
in becoming involved with the project, but not necessarily as an Energy Tracer,
there are many areas where we would value contributions:

- Be an assistant surveyor, working and learning alongside our experienced Energy Tracers ([more details](/news/2019-08-22-volunteer-assistant-surveyor-job-vacancy)).

- Community outreach/engagement and promotion of the project;

- Publicising its surveys, and opportunities for Energy Tracers;

- Coordination and organisation for surveys;

- Social media;

- Website development, graphic design;

- Data analysis;

<!--
- By collecting thermal images of buildings to expand our [Heatview
  map](http://www.heatview.co.uk) (this involves operating a CHEESE thermal
  imaging camera, for which there will be a short training session provided).
-->

We are also open to suggestions of ways to improve the project!

If you would like to become involved with CHEESE as a volunteer, or just want
to find out more then please get in touch by emailing
[info@cheeseproject.co.uk](mailto:info@cheeseproject.co.uk) to introduce
yourself.
