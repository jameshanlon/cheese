title: CHEESE awarded £10,000 by Bristol Community Energy Fund

We are delighted to announce that we have been awarded £10,000 by the [Bristol
Community Energy Fund](https://www.bristolcommunityenergy.co.uk/). This will
enable us to complete the current 2017/18 season and prepare for the next,
including more training and videos.

It is a vote of confidence at an important time for our project, and also an
acknowledgement of all the hard work that everybody has put into the project so
far. Well done to you!
