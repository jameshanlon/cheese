title: Privacy notice

# Privacy notice

The CHEESE Project CIC is a Bristol-based not-for-profit community enterprise
that aims to reduce domestic energy losses at low cost by providing thermal
imaging surveys, to tackle the problems of climate change and fuel poverty.
Read more about the aims and achievements of the project [here](/overview).

Collection and analysis of data, some of which is personal, is an important
aspect of the CHEESE Project. We strive to limit the privacy impact of our data
collection and processing, doing only what is necessary for the aims of the
project, and doing so transparently.

This privacy notice sets out, in line with the [General Data Protection
Regulation (GPDR)][gdpr-overview], what data we collect, why is necessary
for us to collect it, how we manage it and how the law protects your privacy
rights. If you have any questions or comments about this privacy notice,
including any requests to exercise your legal rights, then please get in touch
via [info@cheeseproject.co.uk](mailto:info@cheeseproject.co.uk).

Please note we have a separate privacy notice for staff and members, which can
be accessed [here](/privacy-notice-staff-and-members).

<a class="anchor" name="why"></a>
## Why do we collect and process personal data?

Personal data means any information about an individual that can be used
directly or indirectly to identify that person. We collect personal data as
part of the the findings of our surveys and feedback from householders for two
reasons:

  1. To collect information on common thermal faults and their remedies in
     domestic buildings, so we can compile and maintain a publicly-accessible
     reference, thereby expanding the impact of the CHEESE Project nationally, or
     even internationally.

  2. To validate, using quantitative and qualitative data from householders,
     whether our approach is effective in achieving our aims, since the project
is unique, experimental and in continual development. This is essential to
underpin our findings in the above point and in scaling up the project within
Bristol and eventually replicating it elsewhere in the country.

<a class="anchor" name="what-data"></a>
## What personal data do we collect?

We collect the following personal data, as part of our data collection
activities within the project:

  - **Survey organisation**. Prior to the survey, we record the householder's
    name, street address, email address, landline and mobile telephone numbers,
    the type of building they live in, the number of rooms in their home, whether
    they feel they can heat it comfortably, the benefit they expect from the
    survey, their availability (for the purposes of scheduling a date), whether
    they believe they qualify for a free survey, the fee paid, and any notes made
    by the coordinator to aid with organising the survey. After the survey, the
    contact details of the householder are possibly used to arrange collection of
    one-month and one-year feedback.

  - **Video and photos of the survey**. During the survey we record video (with
    audio of the surveyor's narration and any discussions) and take still
    pictures of areas of interest.

  - **Survey results**. Following the survey, details of the building are
    recorded: year of construction, occupation type, number of occupants, the
primary and secondary heating types, the primary type of water heating, the
primary type of cooking, depth of loft insulation, number of open fireplaces,
proportion of double glazing; details of the energy use of the home are
recorded: annual use of gas, electricity and sold fuel energy types, and any
renewable energy contribution; and details of the faults identified during the
survey and any corresponding recommendations made. Notes are maintained with
the results of a survey to record any details that might be useful to interpret
the data.

  - **One-month and one-year follow ups**. One month after the survey, we
    collect from householder what remedial work they are planning, what work
they have already done (if any) and their satisfaction with the survey.
One year after the survey, we collect up-to-date annual energy consumption
figures to compare with the previous ones, details of any remedial work they
have done (including contractors used, approximate spends on DIY vs.
professional), details of work they have planned, if they have noticed a
wellbeing or health improvement and any changes in their behaviour. Notes are
maintained to record any details that might be useful to interpret the data.

<a class="anchor" name="processing-data"></a>
## How do we process your data?

We use the **survey organisation data** to setup and schedule the survey, to
organise the collection of the CHEESE box and collection of the one month and
one year follow ups.

We use the **videos** from the survey for assessment of [trainee
surveyors](/surveyor-training) as part of their Continuing Professional
Development (CPD) qualification.

With your permission, we select still **photos** from the survey, combined with
details of the faults identified, to add to our record of common thermal faults
and remedies (reason 1 for collecting data). We only choose photos that:

  - clearly display a building construction fault;
  - clearly display the effect of insulation or draught proofing; or
  - show anything else of interest or out of the ordinary.

We do not use any photos that clearly identify a specific person or place, and
where photos do contain features of a home, they are only recognisable by the
householder or their friends or family. The collection of common faults and
remedies will be made publically available via our website. You may request an
image taken during your survey be removed from the collection; please see the
section on [your rights](#individual-rights) for details on how to do this. 

Lastly, we use the **survey results** and **one-month and one-year follow up
data** to perform an analysis of the effectiveness of our methods (reason 2 for
collecting data). We are looking for ways to show how we are achieving the aims
of the project: to reduce domestic energy consumption and improve the health
and wellbeing of the fuel poor. New aggregated data will be created as a result
of this processing, but it is no longer considered personal since it cannot be
used to identify an individual.

<a class="anchor" name="data-retention"></a>
## How long do we retain your data?

The period for which we retain different types of personal data varies
depending on what we are using it for. In all cases, we only retain personal
data for as long as it is necessary to fulfil the purposes we collected it for.

  - We retain personal survey organisation data for as long as is required to
    perform the one-year follow ups.

  - The survey videos are deleted once we have used them for CPD assessment.

  - The survey photos that we select for publication are kept indefinitely.

  - The survey results and follow up data is kept for as long as we believe we
    can usefully extract information from it, potentially in collaboration with
third parties (see '[Who do we share your data with?](/#sharing-data)').

<a class="anchor" name="lawful-basis"></a>
## What is our lawful basis for collecting and processing personal data?

The GDPR requires the collection and processing of personal data to have a
lawful basis. The most appropriate basis for the operation of the CHEESE
Project is [legitimate interest][gdpr-legitimate-interests] on the basis of
achieving the above goals, since they both have clear benefits to wider society
and we cannot reasonably achieve the result in a less intrusive way. We have
documented the details of this justification in our [legitimate interest
assessment](/legitimate-interest-assessment).

<a class="anchor" name="sharing-data"></a>
## Who do we share your data with?

We will only share the data we collect with third parties, such as a university
or other community organisation, when they are collaborating with us to perform
an analysis. We will make efforts to anonymise the data by removing names and
direct contact details. We will always make the results of any such third-party
collaboration and processing of our data freely available.

We may store our data on cloud storage services like Dropbox, Google Drive, or
Amazon Webservices, but we will do so only when the service complies with the
GDPR. Furthermore, these services are only accessible only by password-based
authentication and are not available to the general public.

<a class="anchor" name="security-measures"></a>
## How do we keep your data safe?

We take necessary measures to ensure the security of the personal data we hold
from being accidentally lost, used or accessed in an unauthorised way, altered
or disclosed. These measures include limiting access to only staff of the
CHEESE Project via password-based authentication, we keep the webserver that
stores our data operational with basic security measures and up-to-date with
the latest security patches, and access to the website is secured with SSL (an
encrypted connection) so that any personal data is encrypted and cannot be
intercepted by a third party. We review our security policy regularly to ensure
it remains effective and to highlight areas for improvement.

<a class="anchor" name="individual-rights"></a>
## What rights do I have over my data?

The GDPR provides [rights to individuals][gdpr-individual-rights] over their
personal data. Upon request, you can:

  - **Access your data**. We can provide a copy of all of the data we hold on you
    in a portable data format such as in text format, Microsoft Excel or CSV
spreadsheet file.

  - **Correct your data**. It is important that the personal data we hold on
    you is accurate. If you believe any is incorrect, then please inform us so
that we can correct it.

  - **Delete your data**. You have the right for any or all of your personal
    data that we hold on you to be deleted.

In some circumstances you can:

  - **Restrict the processing of your data**. This applies when the accuracy of
    the data is contested, the data has been unlawfully processed, the data is
no longer useful for CHEESE but you require us to keep it in order to exercise
or defend a legal claim, or you believe your privacy interests override our
legitimate interests.

  - **Object to the processing of your data**. This applies when you believe
    your privacy interests override our legitimate interests.

In these two cases, where we have no grounds to refuse we will stop processing
your data. This may involve deleting your data permanently.

If you wish to exercise any of your legal rights, then please email
[info@cheeseproject.co.uk](mailto:info@cheeseproject.co.uk) with the details of
your request. We may need to ask for specific information from you in order to
confirm your identity.
