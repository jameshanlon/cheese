This year, [Bristol Green Doors](https://www.bristolgreendoors.org/events)
teamed up with C.H.E.E.S.E. to offer each householder a free thermal-imaging
survey prior to the open-homes weekend. This was a great opportunity for us to
survey some intereresting buildings with a variety of retrofit measures, and we
provided some useful video footage that could be played at the open days. For
the householders, it was a new way to view the performance of their homes.
