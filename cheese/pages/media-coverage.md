- **Passivhaus: The Energy Efficiency Podcast – episode 2**, June 2019. CHEESE
  is mentioned in the context of a discussion of the promotion of
energy-efficiency habits, products and information. What they say: The
magnificently named ‘CHEESE Project’ is doing something different from many
community projects. It conducts thermal imaging of a home from low cost to no
cost, depending on a households circumstances. A clear understanding of a
building’s thermal performance is essential so that works to a home are focused in
the right and most cost effective places. CHEESE’s work typically shows
poorly-fitted windows, missing insulation and draughts between floorboards, all
of which can make a home feel quite uncomfortable in cold weather. Listen to
the podcast [here](http://podcast.ecoflap.co.uk/podcast/passivhaus/).
