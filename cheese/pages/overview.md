# Overview

Most of the buildings in which we live are [thermally
inefficient](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_efficiency_in_British_housing).
Much of the energy we use to heat them escapes, providing little benefit, and
costing us money. Domestic energy consumption accounts for [approximately one
third of UK energy
demand](https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/energy-consumption-in-the-uk)
and, also for the [largest peaks in demand](http://gridwatch.co.uk/). Of that,
space and water heating account for [approximately 80% of total domestic energy
consumption](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/energy-consumption-in-the-uk).

One [study has
shown](http://www.demandenergyequality.org/2030-energy-scenario.html) that we
need to reduce domestic demand by 57% if we are to transition to a decarbonised
energy system and reduce global warming to [an 'acceptable'
2C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avoiding_Dangerous_Climate_Change).  By
reducing the energy we waste in our homes we can make a positive contribution
to reducing global warming, whilst also saving money on bills, and improving
our comfort and wellbeing.

The aim of The CHEESE Project is to reduce domestic heat losses. We do
this by performing detailed surveys of homes using low-cost thermal imaging
equipment to identify areas where simple but effective remedial action can be
taken. It is estimated that 30% of heating losses are due to drafts, which can
be fixed cheaply and easily when they have been identified.  We record
energy consumption before and after a survey, to verify the impact of our
work.

## Our achievements and plans

<a class="anchor" name="phase-five"></a>
### Phase five (2019/20)

We went into this season without grant funding which meant we were only able to
offer free surveys by working with our partners
[CHAS](http://www.chasbristol.co.uk/) and The WHAM Project (part of
[CSE](https://www.cse.org.uk/)) and Re:work who work day to day with those in
fuel poverty and vulnerable housing. We also increased our prices and had
volunteer survey assistants, rather than being able to pay our assistants as we
had the year before.

As the season progressed we started up a partnership with
[Futureproof](https://www.futureproof.uk.net/), another project of CSE,
providing surveys to their clients as part of larger retrofit packages. This
has worked well and will continue next season.

We also successfully secured funding from the Bristol Impact Fund and
[Hartcliffe and Withywood Community Partnership](https://hwcp.org.uk/) to carry
out surveys with [Re:Work](https://sites.google.com/site/reworkltd/home) in
Filwood, Hartcliffe and Withywood. Two members of the staff team at Re:Work are
trained C.H.E.E.S.E Energy Tracers.

We were then excited to secure funding from [Bath and West Community
Energy](https://www.bwce.coop/) to set up a pilot project in Bath and start
advertising our surveys and recruiting Our focus for the coming season is
twofold: to provide surveys to householders in Bristol and to establish
partnerships with other organisations to catalyse the delivery of surveys at
scale. Both involve providing detailed training in our thermal surveying
protocol to those wanting to deliver surveys from within their own organisation
(Councils, Housing Associations etc) or directly for The C.H.E.E.S.E. Project.
We will provide beginner and refresher training.

The aim of partnership development is to embed this vital service within the
offering of housing providers, and to ensure the ongoing financial
sustainability of The C.H.E.E.S.E. Project as a low-cost service, accessible to
all. We are committed to a low-cost or free-service model in order to meet our
social and environmental objectives, amplified by the increasing urgency of
climate destabilisation.

The positive impact of C.H.E.E.S.E. surveys both on householder behaviour and
empowerment, and energy saving, is unmatched by other commercial
thermal-imaging services. Customer satisfaction is [overwhelmingly
positive](/testimonials), which we believe is due to the knowledge and
sensitivity of the Energy Tracers to the needs of different households and the
fact that the social and environmental objectives are the drivers of our work,
and this comes across to our customers.

Finally, the project also gained vaulable recognition from the [Big Innovation
pitch Award for Buildings](2020-03-04-Futurebuild-Buildings-Innovation-Pitch)
at the prestigious Futurebuild industry event, the [award for Environmental
Impact at the ‘Voscurs’](2020-02-Voscur-awards) Bristol’s social impact awards,
and a feature on BBC Radio 4’s [Costing the Earth](2020-03-Costing-the-Earth)
exposing of the poor quality of new build homes.

### Phase four (2018/19)

This season:

- We carried out **115 surveys**, of those **23 were free** to those on
  benefits and low incomes.

- We worked with [Dhek Bhal](http://www.dhekbhal.org.uk/) and [Golden
  Agers](https://www.wellaware.org.uk/activities/golden-agers/) to offer the
service to our local BAME elders, with [Bedminster Energy
Group](http://www.bedminsterenergy.org.uk/) who subsidised the cost of surveys
for its members.

- We received funding from the Bristol Community Energy Fund to enable us to
  offer our surveys at low cost to all.

- We won the 2018 Community Energy award for '[the most inspiring energy
  conservation and/or management
project](/news/2018-10-community-energy-awards)'.

- We were nominated for the 2019 Climate Coalition's [Green Heart Hero
  Award](/news/2019-03-11-Green-Heart-Hero-awards).

- We recruited [Maddy Longhurst](/governance#maddy-longhurst) as our Survey
  Manager, trained new Energy Tracers and worked with new volunteers.

### Phase three (2017/18)

This season:

- We carried out **91 surveys**, of those **38 were free** to those free on
  benefits and low incomes.

- We trained new Energy Tracers and worked with new volunteers.

- Nick Clack was our Survey Manager for the second year, afterwards moving on
  to work at the Centre for Sustainable Energy.

<a class="anchor" name="phase-two"></a>
### Phase two (2016/17)

Based on the success of our pilot, we developed the CHEESE Project so that it
was able to operate autonomously in the 2016/17 winter surveying season. This
required development of many facets of the project:

- we recruited and trained ten Energy Tracer surveyors, with a two-day course
  that covered the theory and practice of thermal imaging and building
  construction, a half-day health-and-safety course and a set of live surveys
  in which they shadow a trained Energy Tracer;

- we recruited our overall coordinator, Nick Clack, to organise and manage the
  surveys;

- we designed and put together our own CHEESE [energy boxes](/cheese-box) that
  are left with householders for a month after their survey to encourage action
  on saving energy;

- we upgraded our thermal imaging kits to make use of Flir's [new thermal
  imaging camera attachment](http://www.flir.co.uk/flirone) and made numerous
  bug fixes and enhancements to the CHEESE survey software;

- we put together a new website (this one), which also provides facilities to
  manage our survey organisation, results and feedback.

Following this groundwork, we delivered 56 surveys in and around our target
wards, in wide-ranging types of buildings and socioeconomic groups of
householders. During this work, we carefully documented many of common faults
and remedies and we plan to make this information available to the 200,000
households in Bristol.

### The pilot (2014/15)

In the 2015/16 winter we completed a successful pilot of the CHEESE Project in
Bristol and conducted 30 internal home surveys in the wards of Bishopston,
Cotham, Redland, Easton and Lawrence Weston. This brings us to a total of 50
surveys since March 2015.

The pilot surveys were led by Brian Harper, a thermal imaging expert and
founder of the [Transition Malvern
Hills](https://transitionmalvernhills.org.uk) *Energy Tracers*,  the project on
which the Bristol CHEESE Project is modeled. This gave us the opportunity to
road test our new software, which had been in development for over a year, to
use Flir One thermal-imaging cameras for our surveys.

As well as the internal surveys, we also captured a total of 11,000 external
thermal images of domestic properties in the same wards for our Google Street
View-style [Heatview map](http://www.heatview.co.uk), covering Bishopston,
Cotham, Redland, Easton and Lawrence Weston.

For the achievements of the pilot, the CHEESE project [won the Volunteers for Energy
Award](http://bristolgreencapital.org/winners-announced-in-the-green-volunteers-awards-2016)
at the Bristol Green Capital Partnership Green Volunteers' Awards 2016.
