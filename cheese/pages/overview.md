# Overview

Most of the buildings in which we live are [thermally
inefficient](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_efficiency_in_British_housing).
Much of the energy we use to heat them escapes, providing little benefit, and
costing us money. Domestic energy consumption accounts for [approximately one
third of UK energy
demand](https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/energy-consumption-in-the-uk)
and, also for the [largest peaks in demand](http://gridwatch.co.uk/). Of that,
space and water heating account for [approximately 80% of total domestic energy
consumption](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/energy-consumption-in-the-uk).

One [study has
shown](http://www.demandenergyequality.org/2030-energy-scenario.html) that we
need to reduce domestic demand by 57% if we are to transition to a decarbonised
energy system and reduce global warming to [an 'acceptable'
2C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avoiding_Dangerous_Climate_Change).  By
reducing the energy we waste in our homes we can make a positive contribution
to reducing global warming, whilst also saving money on bills, and improving
our comfort and wellbeing.

The aim of the CHEESE Project is to reduce domestic heat losses. We do
this by performing detailed surveys of homes using low-cost thermal imaging
equipment to identify areas where simple but effective remedial action can be
taken. It is estimated that 30% of heating losses are due to drafts, which can
be fixed cheaply and easily when they have been identified.  We record
energy consumption before and after a survey, to verify the impact of our
work.

### The pilot

In the 2015/16 winter we completed a successful pilot of the CHEESE Project in
Bristol and conducted 30 internal home surveys in the wards of Bishopston,
Cotham, Redland, Easton and Lawrence Weston. This brings us to a total of 50
surveys since March 2015.

The pilot surveys were led by Brian Harper, a thermal imaging expert and
founder of the [Transition Malvern
Hills](https://transitionmalvernhills.org.uk) *Energy Tracers*,  the project on
which the Bristol CHEESE Project is modeled. This gave us the opportunity to
road test our new software, which had been in development for over a year, to
use Flir One thermal-imaging cameras for our surveys.

As well as the internal surveys, we also captured a total of 11,000 external
thermal images of domestic properties in the same wards for our Google Street
View-style [Heatview map](http://www.heatview.co.uk), covering Bishopston,
Cotham, Redland, Easton and Lawrence Weston.

For the achievements of the pilot, the CHEESE project [won the Volunteers for Energy
Award](http://bristolgreencapital.org/winners-announced-in-the-green-volunteers-awards-2016)
at the Bristol Green Capital Partnership Green Volunteers' Awards 2016.

### Phase two

Based on the success of our pilot, we developed the CHEESE Project so that it
was able to operate autonomously in the 2016/17 winter surveying season. This
required development of many facets of the project:

- we recruited and trained ten Energy Tracer surveyors, with a two-day course
  that covered the theory and practice of thermal imaging and building
  construction, a half-day health-and-safety course and a set of live surveys
  in which they shadow a trained Energy Tracer;

- we recruited our overall coordinator, Nick Clack, to organise and manage the
  surveys;

- we designed and put together our own CHEESE [energy boxes](/cheese-box) that
  are left with householders for a month after their survey to encourage action
  on saving energy;

- we upgraded our thermal imaging kits to make use of Flir's [new thermal
  imaging camera attachment](http://www.flir.co.uk/flirone) and made numerous
  bug fixes and enhancements to the CHEESE survey software;

- we put together a new website (this one), which also provides facilities to
  manage our survey organisation, results and feedback.

Following this groundwork, we delivered 56 surveys in and around our target
wards, in wide-ranging types of buildings and socioeconomic groups of
householders. During this work, we carefully documented many of common faults
and remedies and we plan to make this information available to the 200,000
households in Bristol.

### Phase three

In winter 2017/18 we want to increase the scale of the CHEESE Project to reach
even more homes, and we are keen to establish further partnerships in Bristol,
and possibly elsewhere in the UK, to enable us to do this.
