title: 2018 project progress reports

We have recently published two reports on our last year and the 2017/18 survey
season.

Our progress report outlines how the project has developed. It highlights that
last year was a crucial step in the project's development. We engaged with a
range of community organisations, helping us to expand the project, and as such
we performed the largest number of surveys in a season to date, with consistent
high-quality feedback from householders. We have also been continuing to
develop our technology, raise money and lobby local and national government.

The analysis report presents our findings from the data we have collected
from surveys and the follow ups we do with householders. It analyses data from
the 2016/17 and 2017/18 survey seasons, from a total of 111 respondents, and
shows that overall survey satisfaction is high, with householders satisfied with
all aspects of their survey, and that 69% of householders had undertaken some
form of remedial action one month after their survey.
