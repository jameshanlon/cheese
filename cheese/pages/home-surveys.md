**Our internal thermal-imaging surveys aim to improve the comfort and energy
efficiency of your home, to you save money on your bills and to reduce your
climate impact.**

The survey process is based on a unique methodology developed by Brian Harper,
who has been working with thermal imaging for 45 years and has surveyed over
400 homes.

<!--The method involves heating the house to 10 degrees above ambient
temperature, reducing the indoor pressure and locating incoming cold draughts,
inadequate insulation, poor construction, etc.

The householder observes the survey and is informed of any energy-loss
problems as they are revealed. The survey is also filmed, capturing the
live thermal images and commentary from the surveyor, to provide to the
householder for future reference.-->

## How it works

We perform surveys in the winter so that when a house is heated there is a
large difference between the temperature inside the house compared to the
outside.

During the survey, a large extractor fan is fitted to an external door and run
continuously to reduce the pressure inside the house. This causes cold air to
be drawn in though any gaps. As we work through each room in the house we use
the thermal imaging camera to look for cold spots. These may be caused by gaps
to the outside through which draughts are pulled by the fan, or by poor thermal
insulation from cold bridging or missing insulation etc.

As the householder, you are involved directly with the survey by accompanying
the surveyor to see first hand how heat moves around your home and where it is
lost.  The entire survey is recorded as a video with audio of the surveyor's
commentary and any discussions you might have with them. The video is given to
you afterwards on a USB memory stick, so you can review the findings at any
point.

Following the survey, a briefing is carried out on the main problems that were
identified and how they might be remedied. We will record your current energy
use by looking at your gas and electricity bills (you will need to [find them
in advance](/pre-survey-guide#preparation) and you will have the opportunity to
borrow a *CHEESE energy monitoring and action pack* containing simple-to-use
meters to monitor energy use and information on DIY energy-saving techniques.

Because we are continuously developing the CHEESE Project and its approach, we
will ask you to complete a short questionnaire after the survey to obtain
feedback and to learn how effective the survey was for you. We will follow up
again after a month and after a year to see if your energy use has changed!

## Pricing

Below are our prices for various sizes of home; note that rooms means
reception rooms plus bedrooms.

We do offer **free surveys** to households on low incomes. We assess
eligibility for free surveys on a case-by-case basis. It will be useful for us
to know whether you are receiving benefits and whether you meet the [Minimum
Income Standard](http://www.lboro.ac.uk/research/crsp/mis/), which you can find
out using an [online calculator](http://www.minimumincome.org.uk/).

\* We generally only survey large houses at weekends, though there may be some
limited availability for surveying large houses on other days.

**A note on our pricing**: The CHEESE project is a not-for-profit volunteer-run
organisation, which allows us to provide surveys at very low cost. Our highest
charge is less than half the true cost of delivering the survey if we were to
factor in the true cost of staff time and other overheads. For free surveys, we
additionally rely on grant funding to make up the difference. The overwhelming
response that we get is that our surveys are fascinating and exceptionally good
value.
