# Home thermal-imaging surveys

**Our internal thermal-imaging surveys *enable you* to improve the comfort and
energy efficiency of your home, so you save money on your bills and to reduce
your climate impact.**

Our unique survey process was developed after studying methods used in the UK
and USA of thermal imaging and pressure testing, including methods recommended
by Ian Mawditt of Four Walls Consultants and Philip Haile of Transition
Bath. Subsequently we worked with Brian Harper in Malvern, who had been
developing thermal Imaging since the 1970s and who had his own low-cost protocol for
internal surveys using pressure-reduction. We adapted this system using new
cameras and digital software and licensed the use of his Energy Tracers name
for three years until January 2022. We now use a unique bespoke Heatview®
camera and software developed by our technical director Jeremy Birch. Our
training for Heatview® surveyors has also been specifically developed based on
6 year’s experience and over 500 surveys.


## How it works

We can perform surveys when there is an adequate difference in temperature (8
degrees C) between the inside the house and the outside. So our surveys in the
South begin in autumn and continue through to Spring. Further North our survey
season is longer. 

A surveyor will come at the prearranged time. Firstly, a large extractor
fan is fitted to an external door and run continuously to reduce the pressure
inside the building. This causes cold air to be drawn in though any gaps. As we
work through each room in the house we use the thermal imaging camera to look
for cold spots which point to thermal faults in the fabric of the building.
These may be caused by gaps to the outside through which draughts are pulled by
the fan, or by poor thermal insulation from cold bridging or missing insulation
etc.

As the householder, you are involved directly with the survey by accompanying
the surveyor to see first hand how heat moves around your home and where it is
lost.  The entire survey is recorded as a video with audio of the surveyor's
commentary and any discussions you might have with them. The video is given to
you afterwards on a USB memory stick, so you can review the findings at any
point.

Following the survey, a briefing is carried out on the main problems that were
identified and how they might be remedied, but we cannot offer this as
professional advice. You must always consult an expert to determine the best
way forward. We will record your current energy use by looking at your gas and
electricity bills (you will need to [find them in
advance](/pre-survey-guide#preparation)). 

Because we are continuously developing the CHEESE Project and its approach, we
will ask you to complete a short questionnaire after the survey to obtain
feedback and to learn how effective the survey was for you. We will follow up
again after a month and after a year to see if your energy use has changed!
