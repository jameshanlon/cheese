title: Successful registration as a community interest company (CIC)

We are very pleased to announce that, effective from 14th February 2018, the
CHEESE project is now registered as a community interest company (CIC).

This status was granted by the CIC regulator on the basis that the our
activities are carried out for the benefit of residents of Greater Bristol and
then the United Kingdom and that they contribute to a reduction in energy loss
from homes. The project also assists those who have difficulty affording their
fuel bills to have more comfortable homes. It helps to reduce greenhouse gas
emissions and fuel bills, contributing to warmer homes and a cooler planet.

Our CIC registration is an important step to formalise the staus of the project
as a recognised legal entity, superceeding our previous status as an
unincorporated association. It makes explict that we exist to benefit the
community, rather than using any profits to benefit shareholders or owners. Our
new [articles of association

aims, structure and governance of the CHEESE Project CIC.
