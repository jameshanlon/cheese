We held our second training session on 26th/27th November, which was again
kindly hosted by the [Ambition Lawrence Weston](http://www.ambitionlw.org/)
youth centre. After a productive two days of the theory and practice of
domestic thermal imaginag, five more enthusiastic traineers are well on their
way to becoming fully-fledged Energy Tracers!
