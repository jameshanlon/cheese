### At Redland May Fair, May 2017

This year's [Redland May Fair](http://www.rcas.org.uk/redland-fair) was hugely
successful and attracted large crowds on a beautiful sunny day. We spoke to
lots of people about the warmth of their homes, retrofit and the value of
having a CHEESE thermal imaging survey. That was until the heavens opened and
we all got very wet. Thank you to Bristol Energy Network who kindly lent us
their new gazeebo.

We held our second training session on 26th/27th November, which was again
kindly hosted by the [Ambition Lawrence Weston](http://www.ambitionlw.org/)
youth centre. After a productive two days of the theory and practice of
domestic thermal imaginag, five more enthusiastic traineers are well on their
way to becoming fully-fledged Energy Tracers!

### Health and Safety for home visits workshop, November 2016

The [Centre for Sustainable Energy](https://www.cse.org.uk/) provided a training
session this weekend for trainee CHEESE Energy Tracers on health and safety for
home visits. This provided a forum to discuss the expectations of the surveyor
and the householder and issues associated with visiting peoples homes,
including the risks.

### First Energy Tracer training session, October 2016

We ran a successful first training session for Energy Tracers surveyors on
9th/10th October, held at the [Ambition Lawrence
Weston](http://www.ambitionlw.org/) youth centre. This was a full two days,
which included the theory of thermal imaging and building construction, and
introduction to the CHEESE thermal imaging equipment and hands-on experience
with some practice surveying.

### At the Bristol Energy Hub, April 2016

[Bristol Energy](www.bristol-energy.co.uk) kindly invited the CHEESE project to
run a stall on 2nd and 9th April in their new Energy Hub, located on the
Bristol Harbourside. This was a great opportunity to showcase the achievements
and ambitions of CHEESE to members of the public.
