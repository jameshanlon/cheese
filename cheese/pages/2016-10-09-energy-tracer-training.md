title: First Energy Tracer training session

We ran a successful first training session for Energy Tracers surveyors on
9th/10th October, held at the [Ambition Lawrence
Weston](http://www.ambitionlw.org/) youth centre. This was a full two days,
which included the theory of thermal imaging and building construction, and
introduction to the CHEESE thermal imaging equipment and hands-on experience
with some practice surveying.
