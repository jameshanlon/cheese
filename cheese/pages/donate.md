<h2>Make a donation to tackle fuel poverty in Bristol</h2>

<p>The C.H.E.E.S.E. Project CIC is a not-for-profit community-based
organisation. We offer our surveys for free to low-income households, as part
of our efforts to tackle fuel poverty. <strong>Fuel poverty affects one in ten
families in Bristol, who may have to chose between heating, eating, and paying
the rent.</strong></p>

<p>As grant funding to deliver free surveys can be hard to secure and only
available intermittently, we are gratefully appealing for donations to support
this work. Every donation will make a positive difference to someone's
life.</p>

<p>Your donation will go towards:</p>

<ul>

<li>Providing a free survey to someone in poor housing and/or on a low income
who would not otherwise be able to afford it without your help.</li>

</ul>
<ul>

<li>Enabling these households to carry out targeted and effective draft
proofing to lower their bills and improve their comfort.</li>

</ul>
