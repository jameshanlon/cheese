<h2>Make a donation to tackle fuel poverty in Bristol</h2>

<p>The C.H.E.E.S.E. Project CIC is a not-for-profit community-based
organisation. We offer our surveys for free to low-income households, as part
of our efforts to tackle fuel poverty. <strong>Fuel poverty affects one in ten
families in Bristol, who may have to chose between heating, eating, and paying
the rent.</strong></p>

<p>Because grant funding has become increasingly difficult to obtain, we are
now appealing for donations to support our work. If you would like to help
those in fuel poverty to have free surveys, please donate here.</p>

<p>Every donation will go towards:</p>

<ul>

<li>Providing a free survey to someone in poor housing and/or on a low income
who would not otherwise be able to afford it without your help.</li>

</ul>
<ul>

<li>Enabling these households to carry our targeted and effective draft
proofing to lower their bills and improve their comfort.</li>

</ul>
