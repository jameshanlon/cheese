# Make a donation

The C.H.E.E.S.E. Project is a not-for-profit community-based organisation. We
offer surveys to low-income households for free as part of our efforts to
tackle fuel poverty. This affects one in ten families in Bristol - who may have
to chose between heating, eating, and paying the rent. 

We have, in the past, been able to offer our surveys for free through grant
funding. But this has become increasingly difficult to obtain. We are now
appealing for donations, so if you would like to help those in fuel poverty to
have free surveys, please donate here.
