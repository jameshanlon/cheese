We are thrilled to have been featured in 'Eco Homes Now!' Costing the Earth,
first aired on 17th March 2020. In the episode, one of our Energy Tracers Zack
Gill performs a survey on a new-build property (4 years old) and finds many
interesting thermal faults.

Details of the episode:

> The demand for housing is pushing through developments of millions of new build
> homes. So why aren't these all being built to the best energy efficiency
> standards possible with the technology that's now available? Tom Heap reveals
> how the scrapping of zero carbon homes has meant years of construction has not
> had to meet the higher standards hoped for. The new Future Homes Standard has
> just been consulted on but Tom Heap hears it's not just missing the mark for
> some groups but is at risk of reducing some standards altogether. 
> 
> Homes now come with an EPC - an Energy Performance Certificate - to test how
> reliable they are Tom trains thermal cameras onto a new build house to reveal
> any leaks or hidden short cuts that may be lurking behind the walls.
> 
> Tom also gets a vision of the future - where clever design on village scale and
> with artificial intelligence could see us living in a low carbon way without
> even having to think too hard about it. 
> 
> Presented by Tom Heap 
> Producer: Anne-Marie Bullock.
