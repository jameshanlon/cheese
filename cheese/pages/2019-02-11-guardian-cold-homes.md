A recently published [Guardian article][1] highlights serious problems with the
thermal efficiency of new-build homes in the UK. It suggests two issues are at
the heart of the  matter: dot-and-dab dry lining and poor standards of
inspection.

Dot-and-dab is a technique of attaching plasterboard to masonary walls, to
provide a even surface to cheaply and easily skim plaster over. We have
encountered dot-and-dab in our surveys in Bristol and seen it as a cause of
thermal faults by channelling cold airflow within a building. As well as being
an issue in new builds, we have seen it as a problem in older buildings where
it is used as part of energy-efficiency retrofit. In the worst cases, the
effect can be likened to living in a plasterboard tent inside your home. The
example images below show cold air from a floor cavity circulating behind
plasterboard in a wall, between the adhesive dots and dabs.

The problems associated with dot and dab dry lining are avoided easily by
ensuring adhesive is applied along the width and length of boards to provide a
barrier to airflow. Unfortunately however, remedying exisitng dot and dab is
not straightforward and in most cases will require the dry lining to be
replaced.

The second issue of poor inspection standards highlighted is a pricipal
motivation for why we carry out our thermal-imaging surveys. Air tightness
tests provide a measurement of the draughts within a building but say nothing
about the effects of poor insulation and cold bridging. This issue particularly
affects new-build houses, where apart from the use of sealants to temporarily
block draughts as mentioned in the article, similar short-term effects are
caused by paints, which crack over time with movement of a structure.
Amusingly, we have seen that spiders can contribute positively to air
tightness, since they construct their webs over draughty spots.

Thermal imagaing is a powerful tool to characterise the thermal
caharacteristics of a building and to spot specific thermal faults. Although it
is unlikely that building regulations will change any time soon, surveys like
ours can be used to empower householders to stand up to house builders and
tradesmen when they cut corners.
