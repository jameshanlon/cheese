A recently published [Guardian article][1] highlights serious problems with the
thermal efficiency of new-build homes in the UK. It suggests two issues are at
the heart of the  matter: dot-and-dab dry lining and poor standards of
inspection.

[Dot-and-dab][2] is a technique of attaching plasterboard to masonry walls
when it is not possible to use screws or nails. Adhesive is applied directly to
the wall in 'dots' and 'dabs' and the board stuck to it. The approach provides
quick and easy way to dry line a wall. Compared to wet wall plastering, it also
provides extra sound and heat insulation, if installed correctly.

We have encountered dot-and-dab in our surveys in Bristol and seen it as a
cause of thermal faults by channelling cold airflow within a building. Cold air
can infiltrate through insulation from the roof or at joist level and cascades
down the back of the plasterboard to exit either at the skirting (by which time
it will have warmed up) or to the outside. As well as being an issue in new
builds, we have seen it as a problem in older buildings where it is used as
part of energy-efficiency retrofit. In the worst cases, the effect can be
likened to living in a plasterboard tent inside your home. The example images
below show cold air from a floor cavity circulating behind plasterboard in a
wall, between the adhesive dots and dabs.

The problems associated with dot and dab dry lining are avoided easily by
ensuring adhesive is applied all around the edge of each sheet of plasterboard
to provide an airtight seal to the wall. This takes much longer, so it is
frequently omitted by house builders. Unfortunately, remedying existing
dot and dab is not straightforward and in most cases will require the dry
lining to be replaced.

The second issue of poor inspection standards highlighted is a principal
motivation for why we carry out our thermal-imaging surveys. [Air tightness
tests][3] provide a measurement of the draughts within a building but say
nothing about the effects of poor insulation and cold bridging. This issue
particularly affects new-build houses, where apart from the use of sealants to
temporarily block draughts as mentioned in the article, similar short-term
effects are caused by paints, which crack over time with movement of a
structure. Additionally, inspection is typically only done on a pre-arranged
sample of houses which can be specially prepared. Unfortunately, with lax
regulations house builders are able to cut corners, leaving new homeowners [in
the lurch][4].

Thermal imaging is a powerful tool to characterise the thermal
characteristics of a building and to spot specific thermal faults. Although it
is unlikely that building regulations will change any time soon, surveys like
ours can be used to empower householders to stand up to house builders and
tradesmen when they cut corners.
