title: Success at the The Funding Network evening

We are delighted to have recieved encouraging support from the members of
The Funding Network (Bristol) at a [live funding
evening](https://www.thefundingnetwork.org.uk/events/tfn-bristol/1310) at TLT
LLP solicitors on 12th October. Mike Andrews made a six-minute presentation,
supported by Green Party Councillor Jerome Thomas and CHEESE members, and
we were rewarded with personal funding bids totalling Â£5,000. This money will
make a valuable contribution to our operations this winter.
