We organised an informal get together on 19 February at the Harbourside YHA.
This was an opportunity for those working on the project, and others who have
expressed an interest in it, to get to know each other, to ask questions and to
provide their own feedback and ideas. Thanks to all who came, and we look
forward to the next one, sometime in the summer.
