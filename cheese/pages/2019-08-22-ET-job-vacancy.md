## Job description

**To conduct thermal image surveys of the interior of homes in Bristol with the
object of improving the energy efficiency of homes.**

The award-winning not-for profit C.H.E.E.S.E. Project is gaining both local and
national recognition having carried out over 300 thermal surveys in Bristol in
four years, using our unique low-cost system. These allow highly targeted
low-cost retrofit, for example by using DIY techniques to stop the draughts
that can waste up to a third of the heat in a home. Our aims are warmer homes
and a cooler planet.

Commencing with a course in Bristol over the weekend of October 5th/6th 2019,
this opportunity begins with free training to a CPD standard in building
construction and our unique method of thermal surveying. We are offering part
time work, according to your availability, daytime, evenings and weekends until
the end of April 2020 (with two weeks leave over Christmas/New Year). There may
be an opportunity to continue the work the following cold season (November 2020
- 30 April 2021). Due to the availability of householders and the nature of our
surveys it will involve, at times, working during the evenings and at weekends.
We require you to commit to an average of at least two surveys per week,
lasting 2.5 - 3 hours, over the survey season. Surveyors always work together
with an assistant and they need access to a car to transport bulky equipment.

Once trained and signed off as competent, pay equates to around £15/hour.
Depending on the size of the house, surveys take from 2.5 to 4 hours, and
payment per survey is from £50 to £76.25 plus local travel expenses. This
includes responsibility for a follow-up call for data after about one month.
Employment is on a freelance contract with payment made against your invoice.
There are more details on the training and the role on the [Energy Tracer
training page](/energy-tracer-training).
