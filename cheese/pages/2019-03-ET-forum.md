We held our first Energy Tracer forum on Saturday 2nd March at the [Ambition
Lawrence Weston](http://www.ambitionlw.org/) youth centre. This was an
opportunity for everyone involved with the project to get together to discuss
the successes, challenges and ways forward with the project, as well as
specific technical issues with thermal imaging and domestic buildings. Thanks
to everyone who came and contributed to such a lively and diverse discussion.
We will now reflect on all of the feedback and look how we can integrate it to
refine and improve the project.
