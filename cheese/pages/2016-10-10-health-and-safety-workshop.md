title: Health and Safety for home visits workshop

The [Centre for Sustainable Energy](https://www.cse.org.uk/) provided a
training session this weekend for trainee CHEESE Energy Tracers on health and
safety for home visits. This provided a forum to discuss the expectations of
the surveyor and the householder and issues associated with visiting peoples
homes, including the risks. In the pictures below, the instructor Anna Watts
(from CSE) and the CHEESE Energy Tracers, with the visible light and thermal
