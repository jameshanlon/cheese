The Cabot Institute for the Environment at the University of Bristol, in
partnership with Bristol City Council and the Bristol SDG Alliance, recently
published their report '[Bristol and the
SDGs](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/media-library/sites/cabot-institute-2018/documents/BRISTOL%20AND%20THE%20SDGs.pdf)'
(Sustainable Development Goals).

Under SDG 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy, page 27), CHEESE is cited as one of
the most significant projects tacking fuel poverty in Bristol:

> **WHAT WE'RE DOING - Tackling Fuel Poverty (7.1, 7.3)** One of the most
> significant projects occurring in Bristol to tackle fuel poverty is the Cold
> Homes Energy Efficiency Survey Experts (the C.H.E.E.S.E project). Using
> thermal surveys to assess where leakage occurs in the home, the C.H.E.E.S.E
> project helps people find where they can insulate to save the most money.
> They offer free surveys to those in fuel poverty to help reduce the cost of
> heating.

It's great to receive recognition for the work we've been doing!
