# Rates of pay

Please note these rates are effective from the start of the 2020/21 winter
survey season.

## Qualified ETs and assistants

<div class="alert alert-info">

<h4 class="alert-heading">Please note: volunteer assistants</h4>

<!--<p>This Spring, because we had not received any grants, we had to take a
management decision that we could only afford to use unpaid volunteer
Assistants. The reason for this is that we thought £150 (double last year's
fee) was as much as the market would bear, while the actual cost of a survey to
us is £240 if including overheads - despite all senior management working for
nothing. If we paid assistants we would make a loss on all our survey direct
salary costs - unsustainable. Until we get an additional income stream we
cannot change this decision. An exception to this is when we are paid a
considerably higher survey fee by a client or third party - this has to be in
excess of £240.</p>-->

<p> The company business plan is now that C.H.E.E.S.E. has to be sustainable
financially without grants. This is in order that it can be an exemplar for the
other franchisees who will replicate our process. This has required an
approximately 30% increase on the 2019/20 survey prices, as below. We can also
no longer afford to pay assistants to ETs. Brian's new collapsible door frame
will make setting up the blower door easier. We appreciate that some ETs may
not wish to work alone. In that case we will endeavour to pair you with an
unpaid volunteer assistant who should share your transport. We would like to
reassure you that our new prices are substantially less than the going average
for thermal surveying - even without a blower door - and we know our system is
far superior.</p>

Rates of Pay for qualified ETs (regardless of whether the survey is paid for or
free to the householder):

- 1-2 bedrooms, expected 2 hours per survey: £50.00
- 3 bedrooms, expected 2.5 hours per survey: £58.75
- 4 bedrooms, expected 3 hours per survey: £67.50
- 5+ bedrooms, expected 3.5 hours per survey: £76.25
- Call-out payment: £15

Please note:

 - These rates are based on hourly rates of £17.50 for ETs. If you are unsure
   about the size of the building you surveyed, you can check the details in the
  [database](/admin).
 - Payment is made on the basis of a call-out fee and an hourly rate.
 - The call-out payment will only be paid if the survey is cancelled, otherwise
   it is paid as part of the fee.
 - For qualified ETs, please note that the payment includes conducting the
   1-month follow-up with the customer.
 - For those surveys, following your first day of training surveys, where a
   trainee ET is leading the survey (i.e taking responsibility) but supervised by
   an experienced ET, we pay a flat fee of £20 per survey to the trainee. After a
   further 3-5 surveys led by you, Brian Harper or one of our experienced ETs will
   confirm that you are competent and you will be ‘signed off as qualified’. You
   can then carry out surveys unsupervised.
 - Since we are now operating in Bath and outlying villages in the Bristol
   Postcode area, for any travel beyond 5 miles from the city centre, we will
   now pay for ET's travel time. Example, Compton Dando: 10 miles from City centre
   we will pay for the 5 extra miles there and back = 10 miles of travel time at
   £17.50/hour = 29p/minute. Travel times are available on Google maps etc.
 - The survey payment will only be made on the completion of all the following tasks:
    * Full survey with memory-stick and paper report delivered to householder.
    * Upload of survey results.
    * Follow-up phone call after one month to check on the householder’s progress
      if they haven’t already filled it in themselves.

## Trainee ETs

The training system is that you will (usually on one day) observe one survey
with Brian Harper as a pair of trainees, then take it in turns to lead a survey
under supervision. You will then lead from two to five more surveys under the
supervision of an experienced ET, being paid a flat rate of £20. 

We will examine further recordings of your surveys during the season to monitor
your progress and expertise, giving further instruction where necessary. If
these are considered to be satisfactory, you will be 'signed off' and become
eligible for the fees above. 

At the end of the season, after the tapes of several of your last surveys have
been reviewed and are found to be satisfactory, you will be awarded a CPD
certificate.


## Expenses

You can claim for Bristol bus tickets for CHEESE business that you would not
otherwise have had to purchase.

You can claim mileage at 45 pence per mile if it is necessary to use your car
on CHEESE business, such as during surveying to carry surveying equipment.

If you have to get a train for CHEESE surveying business, that you would not
otherwise have to get, you can claim for the cheapest return ticket available
at the time of booking, but please get permission in advance from Nettie Burd
or Mike Andrews.

If it is unavoidable, for example if neither Energy Tracer on a survey has
access to a car, then you can claim for car-club car hire costs incurred on
CHEESE business, but the amount must be agreed in advance with Nettie Burd
or Mike Andrews.
