## Trainee ETs

The training system is that you will (usually on one day) observe one survey
with Brian Harper as a pair, then take it in turns to lead a survey under supervision.
You will then do at least two more surveys under the supervision of an
experienced ET, being paid a flat rate of £20. 
If these are considered to be satisfactory, you will be 'signed
off' and become eligible for the fees above.

At the end of the season, after the tapes of several of your last surveys have
been reviewed by Brian as being satisfactory, you will be awarded a CPD
certificate by Brian’s Energy Tracer CIC.

## Expenses

You can claim for Bristol bus tickets for CHEESE business that you would not
otherwise have had to purchase.

You can claim mileage at 45 pence per mile if it is necessary to use your car
on CHEESE business, such as during surveying to carry surveying equipment.

If you have to get a train for CHEESE surveying business, that you would not
otherwise have to get, you can claim for the cheapest return ticket available
at the time of booking, but please get permission in advance from Maddy
Longhurst or Mike Andrews.

If it is unavoidable, for example if neither Energy Tracer on a survey has
access to a car, then you can claim for car-club car hire costs incurred on
CHEESE business, but the amount must be agreed in advance with Maddy Longhurst
or Mike Andrews.
