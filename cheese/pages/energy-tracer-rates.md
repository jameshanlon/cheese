## Trainee ETs

The training system is that you will (usually on one day) observe one survey
with Brian as a pair, then take it in turns to lead a survey under supervision.
You will then do at least two more surveys under the supervision of an
experienced ET. If these are considered to be satisfactory, you will be 'signed
off' and become eligible for a flat £20.00 training fee for subsequent surveys
that you **lead**. If you assist and are 'signed off' you will receive £15.00.

After the tapes of several of these surveys have been reviewed by Brian as
being satisfactory, you will be considered to be qualified on the practical
surveys and will be paid the rates as above.

You are, from the start, eligible for the 'Finder's fee'.
