The C.H.E.E.S.E. Project are delighted to receive the generous donation from
[Waitrose's Give a Little Love
fund](https://www.waitrose.com/ecom/content/about-us/communities/give-a-little-love).
This will mean we can provide free Energy Tracing home surveys to low-income
households.

Even before the Covid pandemic, 11% of the households in Bristol struggled to
pay for heating, paying the rent and eating. Now with cut-backs in Universal
Credit and soaring energy prices it will be far more.

The community-based C.H.E.E.S.E. project shows, with a unique thermal-imaging
survey, exactly where your home is losing that expensive heat. "When you see it
you can fix it," as one of our clients said - with DIY and as little as £100
you can save up to a third of your heat loss.

If more prosperous readers would like to donate their Winter Fuel Allowance to
the not-for-profit project. This will mean we can help more families on low
incomes to have a warmer, healthier home. You can dontate through our website
[here](/donate).

money to provide free thermal surveys to households in fuel poverty. Left in
