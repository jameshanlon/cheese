title: Completion of this winter's survey season

With the weather becoming warmer, we are drawing to the end of our 2017/18
winter surveying season. We are delighted to report that we have completed 85
surveys as of 12 March, with 3 more scheduled for this weekend. We are most
encouraged to have exceeded our plan to carry out 80 surveys. And, also as
planned, a third of our surveys have been done for free for householders on low
incomes. This is thanks to the fantastic efforts of our dedicated survey
coordinator, volunteers and volunteer management.

## Surveys next season

If you are interested in having a CHEESE survey, then although you have missed
this season, we encourage you to apply for a one via our online form, so we can
book you in for October/November 2018. It is very useful for us to have advance
bookings to spread our workload, as we tend to get most requests late in the
winter.

## Becoming involved with CHEESE

If you are interested in becoming involved with this unique project: as a
[volunteer](/volunteering) or [Energy Tracer](/energy-tracer-training), please
read through the information pages to find out more about what these roles
involve and get in touch by emailing
[info@cheeseproject.co.uk](mailto:info@cheeseproject.co.uk) to introduce
yourself.

We will also be recruiting in the Autumn for two paid part-time roles: a survey
coordinator and a part-time book-keeper. We will publish details of the roles
soon, but please don't hesitate to get in touch if you are interested.
