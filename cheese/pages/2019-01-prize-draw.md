To be in the prize draw, you just need to apply for, and have a survey. Apply
via the Survey tab at the top of this website. If you have already had a survey
since 1 November 2018, you will be automatically entered into the draw. Prizes
you could win...so far...!

Five lucky people will win copies of the excellent [Haynes Eco House
manual](https://haynes.com/en-gb/eco-house-manual-paperback). This is the
manual we have in our CHEESE boxes to help people decide what actions they are
going to take as a result of their surveys.

[Easton Market](https://www.facebook.com/easton.market.bristol/) have donated a
delicious box of fresh and other ethically sourced goodies to our prize draw. 

One lucky winner will receive a voucher to give to a friend for a free survey.
