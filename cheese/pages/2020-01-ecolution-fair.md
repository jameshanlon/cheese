On Friday 24th January, we ran a stall at [Ecolution Fair][#ecolution] in Bath.
The aim of the event was to to raise public awareness of the issues and
importance of sustainability and the environment in the age of consumerism. It
was attended by local charities, trusts, educational entertainers and local
businesses selling products.

For us, it was an excellent opportunity to meet members of Bath & Northeast
Somerset council, other sustainability groups and members of the public,
starting a [new chapter](/news/2020-01-BWCE-grant) in the development of
C.H.E.E.S.E.
