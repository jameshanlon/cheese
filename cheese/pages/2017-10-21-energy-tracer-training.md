Our second Energy Tracer training weekend was held on 21st/22nd October, again
at the [Ambition Lawrence Weston](http://www.ambitionlw.org/) youth centre. The
new Energy Tracer recruits learnt about the theory of thermal imaging and
building construction on Saturday, and were introduced to the CHEESE thermal
imaging equipment and hands-on experience with some practice surveying on
Sunday. We also held a refresher session for existing Energy Tracers on Sunday
to prepare them for the upcoming survey season.
