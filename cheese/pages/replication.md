# Setting up a franchised C.H.E.E.S.E. Energy Tracing® Project in your area

As people are increasingly aware of the climate crisis and the fact that 30% of
UK energy use is within homes, we are receiving more and more enquiries from
individuals, NGOs, housing associations, councils, etc. about how to set up a
local C.H.E.E.S.E. Project replica. They recognise that an internal thermal
Energy Trace® of domestic properties, as a part of building appraisal, is the
smart, low-cost, first step to achieve targeted, cost-effective, energy-loss
reduction. Our low-cost Energy Tracing is far more informative than an EPC and
is also highly effective in stimulating retrofitting. Two thirds of our clients
take remedial action within a month, and over 87% within a year.

We are now delighted to report that we have been awarded (in February 2021) a
substantial grant from Energy For Tomorrow (a Centrica initiative) over three
years to develop our new franchising company First Thermal Ltd to replicate The
C.H.E.E.S.E. Project UK wide. Our first task is to develop C.H.E.E.S.E to be
sustainable without grant income (except for free surveys to those in fuel
poverty). It will become a testbed and pilot franchisee. We are also now
seeking other pilot franchisees to develop a successful model, which will have
a low entry cost and sustain franchisees by payments for their surveys.
Royalties on survey income will be paid to First Thermal Ltd To sustain its
running costs. We plan low-cost rental of our newly developed Heatview camera
and Energy Tracer® blower-door equipment, optimally designed for the job, free
training (also being developed) and plan to grant exclusive local licenses for
our system to franchisees.

We hope, Covid permitting, to trial franchising in Autumn 2021. We will
endeavour to keep start-up costs to the minimum, but potential franchisees will
have to have considerable scale to cover their costs and they must be
sustainable long-term. It may be to the advantage of small climate NGOs to form
alliances with their neighbours. In the meantime, we recommend that climate
action NGOs wanting to set up a local franchise should seek opportunities for
funding to cover their core costs. Paid-for surveys provide income, but we will
require a proportion of free surveys to be conducted for free to assist the
fuel poor. We will continue to lobby for central government funding to assist
with these costs. The Lottery Awards for All is another potential source of
funds for community-led groups.

It is important to our social benefit aims that our franchised replicas remain
independent of those carrying out retrofitting businesses, and are engaged with
the local community. They will need to be a registered legal body such as a
co-operative or CIC. Our pricing structure will include payment from sales to
local Energy Tracers®.

We will update this page as further detail becomes available. In the meantime
