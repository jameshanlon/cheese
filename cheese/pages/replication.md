# Setting up a C.H.E.E.S.E. Project in your area

<!--
We regularly receive enquiries from groups in other parts of the country about
how to setup a C.H.E.E.S.E Project in their area. We want to be able to respond
to this accelerating demand and are working on the prototype of our next
generation low-cost thermal camera and ideas and partnerships for expansion. We
are currently looking at different business models that would work and how to
link them together to create a network of expertise and data collection. We
will keep this page updated as things develop.

It is our aim to secure central government funding to support national roll
out, setting up replicas wherever C.H.E.E.S.E is invited. However, we recommend
that each organisation wanting to set up a C.H.E.E.S.E Project in their area
seeks their own funding to cover the costs of set up.

As people are increasingly aware of the climate crisis and the fact that 30% of
UK energy use is within homes, we are receiving more and more enquiries from
individuals, NGOs, housing associations, councils etc about how to set up a
local C.H.E.E.S.E. Project replica. They recognize that a survey of domestic
properties, as a part of building appraisal, is the smart, low-cost first step
to achieve targeted, cost-effective, energy-loss reduction.

To enable a rapid UK-wide expansion, we are currently (Autumn 2020) developing
a franchise model which will have a low entry cost and payments of royalties on
survey income to the central organisation, together with low-cost rental of
equipment, and granting an exclusive local license for our system. We are also
developing our own low-cost, high-specification camera, optimally designed for
the job.

We are optimistic that we will receive funding to enable commencing trial
franchising by Autumn 2021, when we hope that indoor surveying will be possible
again despite the Covid pandemic. We will endeavour to keep start-up costs to
the minimum, but in the meantime we recommend that climate action NGOs wanting
to set up a local franchise should seek opportunities for funding to cover
their core costs â€“ the surveys will pay for themselves. We will continue to
push for central government funding to assist with costs, e.g. for free surveys
for the fuel poor.

It is important to our social benefit aims that our franchised replicas remain
independent of those carrying out retrofitting businesses, and are engaged with
the local community. They will need to be a registered legal body such as a
CIC. Our likely pricing structure will include payment from sales to local
Energy Tracers.

We will update this page as further detail becomes available. In the meantime
