# Setting up a C.H.E.E.S.E Project in your area

We regularly receive enquiries from groups in other parts of the country about
how to setup a C.H.E.E.S.E Project in their area. We want to be able to respond
to this accelerating demand and are working on the prototype of our next
generation low-cost thermal camera and ideas and partnerships for expansion. We
are currently looking at different business models that would work and how to
link them together to create a network of expertise and data collection. We
will keep this page updated as things develop.

It is our aim to secure central government funding to support national roll
out, setting up replicas wherever C.H.E.E.S.E is invited. However, we recommend
that each organisation wanting to set up a C.H.E.E.S.E Project in their area
seeks their own funding to cover the costs of set up.

Further detail on all of this is available on request by emailing
