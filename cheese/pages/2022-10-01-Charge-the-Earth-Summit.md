C.H.E.E.S.E. attended Darren Jones MP’s 'Charge the Earth Summit' conference at
Southmead Greenway Centre on 1st October, where 11 people signed up for First
Thermal surveys. Darren, besides being MP for Bristol North West is also Chair
of the Parliamentary Select Committee for Energy. He has requested a First
Thermal survey (delivered by CHEESE) of his own home.

C.H.E.E.S.E. had information stalls at four other climate venues on the same
day: [Chew Valley Climate and Nature Emergency](https://greenchew.org/),
[Colerne Retrofit
Fair](https://sites.google.com/view/sustainablesherston/retrofit-fair-30th-april-2022),
Farnborough Futures Fair and [Knowle West Media Centre](https://kwmc.org.uk/).
There we were able to encourage participants to achieve warmer homes and a
cooler planet – and also received enthusiastic plaudits from previous
customers.
