# Thermal imaging of Bristol housing

<p>We have been carrying out external thermal imaging surveys by photographing
houses in Bristol streets to reveal the heat being lost, to encourage
householders to request an internal survey. This uses the effective principle
of <i>seeing is believing</i>. All of the images are available on the <a
  href="http://www.heatview.co.uk">Heatview.co.uk</a> website, where you can
browse the map and find your own house (as long as it is in one of our pilot
areas).</p>
