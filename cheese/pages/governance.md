# Governance

The CHEESE Project was setup in 2015, Bristol's Green Capital year, by a small
group of local people concerned about climate change and who wanted to make
Bristol a truly sustainable city. It was formally founded as an unincorporated
association in August 2016, governed by a five-member volunteer management
committee working to a [formal constitution (PDF)]({{url_for('.assets',
filename='files/CHEESE-Constitution-2016-08-17.pdf')}}). In February 2018, the
CHEESE Project was granted Community Interest Company (CIC) status. For more
information on the structure and organisation of the CHEESE Project, please
read our [articles of association (PDF)]({{url_for('.assets',
filename='files/CHEESE-CIC-articles-of-association-2018-03-09.pdf')}}).

The project is organised by a *central office* and operates through
*community segments* and *city partners* who carry out the internal and
external surveys. Community segments are partner associations based in Bristol
city wards and city partners replicate the CHEESE Project, in coordination with
Bristol, in other cities (more details on [who we work with here](/partners)).

Our central office management team consists of seven people:

<p>Technical Director</p>

<p>Jeremy founded a venture-capital funded software company (Pulsic Ltd,
Bristol). With 33 years experience in software and silicon chip design, he is
the author of several patents. Having developed bespoke software to power our
low-cost iPhone-based survey equipment, he has trained 32 surveyors to carry
out more than 200 C.H.E.E.S.E. surveys successfully. He is currently designing
our own custom thermal-imaging camera based on a Raspberry-Pi computer. This
system is currently at the working prototype stage. Jeremy works pro bono for
the project. </p>

<p>Director (trainer and technical development specialist)</p>

<p>Brian developed thermal imaging cameras, in secret, for the government in
1970s working for the Radar Research Laboratory at Malvern. He setup his own
company to produce some of the first commercially-available thermal imaging
camera in the world. More recently, over 5 years, he developed the innovative
survey protocol which was licensed and adapted by the C.H.E.E.S.E. Project,
with his help, for use with miniature thermal cameras, reducing the cost
dramatically. Brian trains and supports staff to our own CPD qualifications.</p>

C.H.E.E.S.E. Project, in 2015-2016 she obtained funding for and organised
pilot energy surveys in Bishopston, Cotham and Redland and has since been
responsible for overseeing the collation of data from the surveys and the
statistical analysis. Before joining the project Sue spent 29 years working as
