title: Volunteering opportunities with CHEESE this winter

With our winter survey season fast approaching, we are looking for volunteers
to assist with our home energy surveys. As an assistant, you will provide
support to an Energy Tracer surveyor with the handling and setting up of
equipment, and engagement with householders. This is a great opportunity to
gain experience of our work and surveying approach, and to make a positive
contribution to tacking climate change and fuel poverty. For ideas of other
ways that you can help with CHEESE, please see our [volunteering
page](/volunteering). 

If you would like to volunteer with CHEESE, or have any specific questions,
then please [send us an email](mailto:info@cheeseproject.co.uk) to introduce
yourself.

Please note that since our surveys involve meeting members of the public and
visiting their homes, we will need you to supply us with a short CV and two
short character references. This is part of our operations policy and we ask
all new surveyors to do so. The references can be from friends or employers but
need to be a written paragraph or two, not just a telephone number.
