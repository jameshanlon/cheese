A recent [Guardian article][article] has reported that the developer Persimmon
has said it would offer up to 1.5% of a property to resolve any construction
faults. This would allow homebuyers to withhold money until the faults were
fixed. The development is encouraging, but it falls short of the typical
retention on a civil engineering contract of 5%. A small proportion of the
surveys we conduct are in new-build properties, and they have revealed faults
such as draughts and potential issues with [dot and dab][dot-and-dab]. The
video footage we provide of the survey would provide excellent evidence of the
existance of thermal faults.
