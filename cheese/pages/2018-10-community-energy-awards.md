title: Community Energy Awards

We are delighted to have won the national 'Community Energy and Carbon Saving
Award', for "The most inspiring energy conservation and/or management project".
The award was presented at this year's [Community Energy
Awards](https://communityenergyengland.org/news/community-energy-awards) at the
Arnolfini in Bristol. The event was hosted by Community Energy England (CEE)
and Community Energy Wales (CEW).

Itâ€™s fantastic that our innovative thermal imaging project has been recognised
for our achievements which with support is scalable. We need to build on this
momentum to put a greater focus on energy efficiency given the scale of carbon
reductions needed over the next 12 years to avoid disastrous climate change and
to tackle fuel poverty head on.

The award is also recognition for all the hard work of the team, and a great
way to kick off this winter's survey season!
