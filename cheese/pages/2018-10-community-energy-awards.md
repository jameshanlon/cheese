title: Community Energy Awards

We are delighted to have won the national 'Community Energy and Carbon Saving
Award', for "The most inspiring energy conservation and/or management project".
The award was presented at this year's [Community Energy
Awards](https://communityenergyengland.org/news/community-energy-awards) at the
Arnolfini in Bristol. The event was hosted by Community Energy England (CEE)
and Community Energy Wales (CEW). It's fantastic recognition for all the hard
work of the team, and a great way to kick off this winter's survey season!
