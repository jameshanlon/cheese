On Saturday 18th June we attended [Community Energy England’s Energy Transition
Conference in Bristol](https://communityenergyengland.org/events/energy-transition-conference).  

It was wonderful to be able to meet people in person again and learn more about
the incredible work being achieved in community energy.  Since The C.H.E.E.S.E.
Project was founded and thrived from support of Bristol’s communities it was an
honour to be able to have a stand at event and to even have a few shout outs
through the day!
