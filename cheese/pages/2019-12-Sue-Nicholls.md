Sue Nicholls, a director and founder of the CHEESE project has died
in November this year after a most courageous battle with cancer.

Sue played a most important role in the founding of the CHEESE Project, by
obtaining funds through the Bishopston, Cotham and Redland (BCR) energy group,
and she remained a constant enthusiast and help in our work right up to when
she attended our last Directors' meeting. We will always be in her debt for her
commitment to energy saving, and steadfast support of the project. Her science
background was most important and helpful in our work to analyse our survey
data.

Sue brought her passion to make a personal contribution to reducing her
family’s carbon footprint by making energy-saving improvements to her own
house, which then became one of the Bristol Green Doors example homes, open
to the public.

Sue then recognised that more could be done to help Bristol to reduce its
energy demand and became involved with The CHEESE Project. At that point, we
had just started out with support from Bristol Green Capital in 2015. Sue
helped to publicise CHEESE at the Redland May Fair, and set up the BCR energy
group shortly afterwards to promote CHEESE parties as a way to promote our
surveys. By the autumn she was part of the management team and she secured a
crucial grant from BCR Neighbourhood Partnership which enabled CHEESE to buy
equipment to start internal thermal surveying.

Since then, thanks to Sue’s continuing hard work, the project has surveyed more
than 300 homes, to great acclaim by the householders. Earning local, national
and international respect. Sue brought her scientific rigour to working with
two successive interns from Bristol University, who were tasked with analysing
the outcomes of the thermal surveys. Thanks to Sue’s contribution and
remarkable, quiet commitment, even when she was seriously ill, the project has
been replicated twice in SE London and there are plans to extend it nationwide
to make a significant contribution to combating climate disruption.

We will miss her greatly.
