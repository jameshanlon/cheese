  Please note that due to the risks around the COVID-19 virus, we have ceased
  all surveys and are no longer taking bookings for surveys the remainder of
  the season. If you would like to make an early booking for the 2020/21 winter
  season, then please continue and fill out the form below.

  <p><strong>Notice on survey availability</strong></p>

  <p>Our home thermal-imaging
  surveys are currently suspended due to the pandemic and the necessity to work
  inside with the windows closed (see <a href="/home-surveys">more details</a>
  on our survey procedure). We are monitoring the situation and Government
  guidance and are poised to recommence surveying as soon as it is safe to do
  so.

  <p>Our surveys normally run from October through to April to obtain an 8
  degree temperature difference inside to outside.
  If you would like to make a booking for the 2021/22 winter
  season, then please use our <a href="/apply-for-a-survey">booking form</a>
  and we will be in touch as soon as we can offer you a survey.</p>

</a>

<p>Please complete the form below to apply for a survey, but before you do, we
ask that you read through the <a href="/pre-survey-guide">survey preparation
and information guide</a> and are happy to make the necessary preparations for
the survey, and to report your progress back to us after one month and after
one year.</p>

<p>CHEESE Project surveys are available to anyone in the greater Bristol area
and we <a href="/partners">work with</a> community-based
groups to deliver surveys in Bishopston, Cotham, Easton, Filwood (Knowle West),
Lawrence Weston, Lockleaze, Redland, and Westbury-on-Trym. Since we are a small
volunteer-led organisation, the number of surveys we can do is limited and they
will be offered on a first-come first-served basis and depend on the scheduling
with other surveys and travel time and costs.</p>

<p>Details of the <strong>survey process</strong> and <strong>pricing</strong>
          can be found on <a href="/home-surveys">this page</a>.</p>

<p>Once you have submitted the form, we will be in contact to organise a date
with you.  If you have any questions about our surveys, then please get in
touch by emailing
<a href="mailto:surveys@cheeseproject.co.uk">surveys@cheeseproject.co.uk</a>.</p>

    <p>As part of the overall aims of the CHEESE Project, we are compiling
    information on common thermal faults and energy-efficiency measures. We
    collect anonymised thermal photos during surveys to use as examples, but
    we need your permission to use them publicly (more details <a
      href="/privacy-notice#processing-data">here</a>).</p>
    {{ macros.render_form_field(form.photo_release) }}
    <p>Having a CHEESE survey requires some preparation beforehand to ensure
    the survey can be performed effectively, and to measure the impact of what
    the project is doing, we will ask you to report your progress one
    month and one year after the survey.</p>
