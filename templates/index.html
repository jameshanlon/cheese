<h3>Thermal imaging of Bristol housing</h3>

<p>We have been carrying out external thermal imaging surveys by photographing
houses in Bristol streets to reveal the heat being lost, to encourage
householders to request an internal survey. This uses the effective principle
of <i>seeing is believing</i>. All of the images are available on the <a
  href="http://www.heatview.co.uk">Heatview.co.uk</a> website, where you can
browse the map and find your own house (as long as it is in one of our pilot
areas).</p>

<h3>Internal home surveys</h3>

<p>Our internal surveys are based on a unique methodology developed by
Brian Harper, who has been working with thermal imaging for 45 years and
has surveyed over 400 homes. The method involves heating the house to 10
degrees above ambient temperature, reducing the indoor pressure and
locating incoming cold draughts, inadequate insulation, poor construction,
etc.</p>

<p>The householder observes the survey and is informed of any energy-loss
problems as they are revealed. The survey is also filmed, capturing the
live thermal images and commentary from the surveyor, to provide to the
householder for future reference.</p>

<p>You can find out more about what is involved with a survey on the
<a href="/home-surveys">information page</a>, and apply for one
on the <a href="/apply-for-a-survey">survey page</a>.</p>
