<p class="lead">Would you like to improve the
comfort and energy efficiency of your home? Would you like to save money on
your bills? Then apply for a survey now!</p>

<p>We are now booking internal thermal-imaging surveys for this winter, between
November and March. The number of surveys we can do is limited and they will be
offered on a first-come first-served basis.</p>

<p>If you would like to apply for a survey, then please use the <a
  href="#apply-form">form below</a>. If you have any other questions about our
surveys, then please get in touch by emailing <a
  href="mailto:surveys@cheeseproject.co.uk">
  surveys@cheeseproject.co.uk</a>.</p>

<a name="whats-involved"></a>
<h3>What's involved</h3>

<p>We perform surveys in the winter - so that when a house is heated there is a
large difference between the temperature inside the house compared to the
outside.</p>

<p>During the survey, a large extractor fan is fitted to an external door
and run continuously to reduce the pressure inside the house. This causes cold
air to be drawn in though any gaps. As we work through each room in the house
we use the thermal imaging camera to look for cold spots. These may be
caused by gaps to the outside through which draughts are pulled by the fan, or
by poor thermal insulation from cold bridging or missing insulation etc.</p>

<p>As the householder, you are involved directly with the survey by
accompanying the surveyor to see first hand how heat moves around your home and
where it is lost.  The entire survey is recorded as a video with audio of the
surveyor's commentary and any discussions you might have. The video is given to
you afterwards on a USB memory stick, so you can review the findings at any
point.</p>

<p>Following the survey, a briefing is carried out on the main problems that
were identified and how they might be remedied. You will have the opportunity
to borrow a CHEESE <i>energy monitoring and action pack</i> containing
simple-to-use meters to monitor energy use and information on DIY energy-saving
techniques.  Because we are continuously developing the CHEESE Project and its
approach, we will ask you to complete a short questionnaire after the survey to
obtain feedback and to learn how effective the survey was for you. We will
follow up again after a month, three months and a year to see if your energy
use has changed!</p>
