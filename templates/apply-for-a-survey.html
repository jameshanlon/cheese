<h1>Apply for a home survey</h1>

<p>We are now booking internal thermal-imaging surveys for this winter, between
November and March. The number of surveys we can do is limited and they will be
offered on a first-come first-served basis.</p>

<p>Please complete the form below to apply for a survey this winter, but before
you do, we ask that you read through the [survey preparation and information
guide](/pre-survey-guide) and are happy to make the necessary preparations for
the survey, and to report your progress back to us after one month and after
one year.</p>

<p>Note that The CHEESE Project concentrates on six wards in Bristol:
<strong>Bishopston</strong>, <strong>Cotham</strong>, <strong>Easton</strong>,
<strong>Filwood (Knowle West)</strong>, <strong>Lawrence Weston</strong> and
<strong>Redland</strong>. We do accept requests for surveys in other wards, but
only if we have the available time, travel and transport.</p>

<p>Once you have submitted the form, we will be in contact to organise a date
with you.  If you have any questions about our surveys, then please get in
touch by emailing <a
href="mailto:surveys@cheeseproject.co.uk">surveys@cheeseproject.co.uk</a>.</p>
