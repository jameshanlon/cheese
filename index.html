      <li><strong>April, 2016.</strong> The CHEESE Project has been granted £10,000 to continue
        its Phase 2 development in 2016/17 by Bristol Community Energy Fund.</li>

      <li><strong>March 26, 2016.</strong> We have now completed over 30
        internal house surveys in Bristol over the winter months, bringing our
        total to over 50 houses since March 2015.  This completes our pilot
        project and we are now ready to expand into other city wards.</li>

      <h3>Overview</h3>

      <p>Most of the buildings in which we live are <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_efficiency_in_British_housing">
        thermally inefficient</a>. Much of the energy we use to heat
      them escapes, providing little benefit, and costing us money. Domestic
      energy consumption accounts for <a
        href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/energy-consumption-in-the-uk">
        approximately one third of UK energy demand</a> and, also for the
      <a href="http://gridwatch.co.uk/">largest peaks in demand</a>. One <a
        href="http://www.demandenergyequality.org/2030-energy-scenario.html">study
        has shown</a> that we need to reduce domestic demand by 57% if we are
      to transition to a decarbonised energy system and reduce global warming
      to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avoiding_Dangerous_Climate_Change">
        an 'acceptable' 2C</a>. By reducing the energy we waste in our homes we
      can make a positive contribution to reducing global warming.</p>

      <p>The aim of the CHEESE Project is to reduce domestic heat losses. We do
      this by performing detailed surveys of homes using low-cost thermal
      imaging equipment to identify areas where simple but effective remedial
      action can be taken. It is estimated that 30% of heating losses are due
      to drafts, which can be fixed cheaply and easily. By recording 'before
      and after' energy consumption, the impact of our surveys can be
      verified.</p>

      <h3>Thermal imaging of Bristol housing</h3>

      <p>We have been carrying out surveys of Bristol streets to encourage
      householders to request an internal survey. This uses the effective
      principle of <i>seeing is believing</i>. All of the images are available
      on the <a href="http://www.heatview.co.uk">Heatview.co.uk</a> website,
      where you can browse the map and find your own house (as long as
      it is in one of our pilot areas).</p>

      <h3>Internal home surveys</h3>

      <p>Our internal surveys are based on a unique methodology developed by
      Brian Harper, who has been working with thermal imaging for 45 years and
      has surveyed over 400 homes. The method involves heating the house to 10
      degrees above ambient temperature, reducing the indoor pressure and
      locating incoming cold draughts, inadequate insulation, poor construction,
      etc.</p>

      <p>The householder observes the survey and is informed of any energy-loss
      problems as they are revealed. The survey is also filmed, capturing the
      live thermal images and commentary from the surveyor, to provide to the
      householder for future reference.</p>

      <h3>Funding</h3>

      <p>The CHEESE pilot project was setup in March 2015 with funding from
      <a href="http://bristolgreencapital.org/">Bristol Green Capital 2015</a>.
      Two initial small grants of £5,000 were
      awarded to <a href="http://www.eastonenergygroup.org">Easton Energy
      Group</a> and <a href="http://www.ambitionlw.org">Ambition Lawrence Weston
      </a>. A further two grants were awarded to the Bishopston, Cotham and
      Redland Neighbourhood Partnership of £2,000 and £1,610.</p>
