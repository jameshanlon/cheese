      <h3>Overview</h3>

      <p> In general, the buildings in which we live are <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_efficiency_in_British_housing">
        thermally inefficient</a>, causing to most of the energy we use to heat
      them to escape outside, which provides little benefit to us. Since
      domestic energy consumption accounts for <a
        href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/energy-consumption-in-the-uk">
        approximately 24% of UK energy demand</a> and, also for the
      <a href="http://gridwatch.co.uk/">largest peaks in demand</a>, it
      is crucial that we all reduce how much energy we use in our homes. One <a
        href="http://www.demandenergyequality.org/2030-energy-scenario.html">study
        has shown</a> that we need to reduce domestic demand by 57% if we are
      to transision to a decarbonised energy system and stay inside <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avoiding_Dangerous_Climate_Change">
        2C of global warming</a>.</p>

      <p>The aim of the CHEESE project is to reduce domestic energy
      consumption, primarily from heat losses. We do this by performing
      detailed surveys of buildings using low-cost thermal imaging equipment to
      identify areas where simple but effective remedial action can be
      taken. It is estimated that 30% of heating losses are due to drafts,
      which can be fixed cheaply and easily. By recording 'before and after'
      energy consumption, the impact of our surveys can be verified.</p>

      <h3>Funding</h3>

      <p>The CHEESE pilot project was setup in March 2015 with funding from
      <a href="http://bristolgreencapital.org/">Bristol Green Capital 2015</a>.
      Two initial small grants of £5,000 were
      awarded to <a href="http://www.eastonenergygroup.org">Easton Energy
      Group</a> and <a href="http://www.ambitionlw.org">Ambition Lawrence Weston
    </a>. A further two grants were awarded to the Bishopston, Cotham and
    Redland Neighbourhood Partnership of £2,000 and £1,610.</p>
