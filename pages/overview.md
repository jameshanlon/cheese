<p>The CHEESE Project aims to reduce domestic energy losses, at low cost,
by up to a third. This saves money, improves health and wellbeing and,
reduces our carbon emissions.</p>

## Overview

Most of the buildings in which we live are [thermally
inefficient](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_efficiency_in_British_housing).
Much of the energy we use to heat them escapes, providing little benefit, and
costing us money. Domestic energy consumption accounts for [approximately one
third of UK energy
demand](https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/energy-consumption-in-the-uk)
and, also for the [largest peaks in demand](http://gridwatch.co.uk/). Of that,
space and water heating account for [approximately 80% of total domestic energy
consumption](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/energy-consumption-in-the-uk).

One [study has
shown](http://www.demandenergyequality.org/2030-energy-scenario.html) that we
need to reduce domestic demand by 57% if we are to transition to a decarbonised
energy system and reduce global warming to [an 'acceptable'
2C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avoiding_Dangerous_Climate_Change).  By
reducing the energy we waste in our homes we can make a positive contribution
to reducing global warming, whilst also saving money on bills, and improving
our comfort and wellbeing.

The aim of the CHEESE Project is to reduce domestic heat losses. We do
this by performing detailed surveys of homes using low-cost thermal imaging
equipment to identify areas where simple but effective remedial action can be
taken. It is estimated that 30% of heating losses are due to drafts, which can
be fixed cheaply and easily when they have been identified.  We record
energy consumption before and after a survey, to verify the impact of our
work.

## Our achievements and plans

Last 2015/16 winter we completed a successful pilot of the CHEESE Project in
Bristol in Bishopston, Cotham, Redland, Easton and Lawrence Weston.  We
conduced over 50 internal house surveys and captured 11,000 thermal images of
domestic properties in the same wards for our [Heatview
map](http://www.heatview.co.uk).

For this work, the CHEESE project [won the Volunteers for Energy
Award](http://bristolgreencapital.org/winners-announced-in-the-green-volunteers-awards-2016)
at the Bristol Green Capital Partnership Green Volunteers' Awards 2016.

Based on the success of our pilot, we enhanced and expanded the CHEESE Project
in winter 2016/17, including surveying in more areas of Bristol. We have
documented a wide range of common faults and remedies and we plan to make this
information available to the 200,000 households in Bristol.

In winter 2017/18 we want to increase the scale of the CHEESE Project to reach
even more homes, and we are keen to establish further partnerships in Bristol,
and possibly elsewhere in the UK, to enable us to do this.
