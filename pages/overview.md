<p>The CHEESE Project aims to reduce domestic energy losses, at low cost,
by up to a third. This saves money, improves health and wellbeing and,
reduces our carbon emissions.</p>

## Overview

Most of the buildings in which we live are <a
  href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_efficiency_in_British_housing">
  thermally inefficient</a>. Much of the energy we use to heat
them escapes, providing little benefit, and costing us money. Domestic
energy consumption accounts for <a
  href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/energy-consumption-in-the-uk">
  approximately one third of UK energy demand</a> and, also for the
<a href="http://gridwatch.co.uk/">largest peaks in demand</a>. Of that, space
and water heating account for
<a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/energy-consumption-in-the-uk">
  approximately 80% of total domestic energy consumption</a>.

One <a
  href="http://www.demandenergyequality.org/2030-energy-scenario.html">study
  has shown</a> that we need to reduce domestic demand by 57% if we are
to transition to a decarbonised energy system and reduce global warming
to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avoiding_Dangerous_Climate_Change">
  an 'acceptable' 2C</a>.
By reducing the energy we waste in our homes we
can make a positive contribution to reducing global warming, whilst also saving
money on bills, and improving our comfort and wellbeing.

The aim of the CHEESE Project is to reduce domestic heat losses. We do
this by performing detailed surveys of homes using low-cost thermal imaging
equipment to identify areas where simple but effective remedial action can be
taken. It is estimated that 30% of heating losses are due to drafts, which can
be fixed cheaply and easily when they have been identified.  We record
energy consumption before and after a survey, to verify the impact of our
work.

## Our achievements and plans

Last 2015/16 winter we completed a successful pilot of the CHEESE Project
  in Bristol in Bishopston, Cotham, Redland, Easton and Lawrence Weston.
  We conduced over 50 internal house surveys and captured 11,000 thermal images
  of domestic properties in the same wards for our <a
  href="http://www.heatview.co.uk">Heatview map</a>.

For this work, the CHEESE project <a
  href="http://bristolgreencapital.org/winners-announced-in-the-green-volunteers-awards-2016">
  won the Volunteers for Energy Award</a> at the Bristol
Green Capital Partnership Green Volunteers' Awards 2016.

Based on the success of our pilot, we are planning to expand the CHEESE
Project in Bristol this winter. We will conduct over 200 internal surveys of
homes and expand the Heatview dataset to include more Bristol streets. From
this experience we will document common faults and remedies and make this
information available to the 200,000 households in Bristol.

In winter 2017/18 we want to double the scale of the CHEESE Project to
survey over 400 houses, and we are keen to establish city partners elsewhere in
the UK.
