title: First Energy Tracer training session for this winter

We ran a successful first training session for Energy Tracers surveyors on
9th/10th October. This was a full two days, which included the theory of
thermal imaging and building construction, and introduction to the CHEESE
thermal imaging equipment and hands-on experience with some practice
surveying.
