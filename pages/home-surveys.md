## Home surveys

We perform surveys in the winter - so that when a house is heated there is a
large difference between the temperature inside the house compared to the
outside.

During the survey, a large extractor fan is fitted to an external door and run
continuously to reduce the pressure inside the house. This causes cold air to
be drawn in though any gaps. As we work through each room in the house we use
the thermal imaging camera to look for cold spots. These may be caused by gaps
to the outside through which draughts are pulled by the fan, or by poor thermal
insulation from cold bridging or missing insulation etc.

As the householder, you are involved directly with the survey by accompanying
the surveyor to see first hand how heat moves around your home and where it is
lost.  The entire survey is recorded as a video with audio of the surveyor's
commentary and any discussions you might have. The video is given to you
afterwards on a USB memory stick, so you can review the findings at any point.

Following the survey, a briefing is carried out on the main problems that
were identified and how they might be remedied. You will have the opportunity
to borrow a CHEESE *energy monitoring and action pack* containing
simple-to-use meters to monitor energy use and information on DIY energy-saving
techniques.  Because we are continuously developing the CHEESE Project and its
approach, we will ask you to complete a short questionnaire after the survey to
obtain feedback and to learn how effective the survey was for you. We will
follow up again after a month, three months and a year to see if your energy
use has changed!

## Testimonials

From someone who struggled to heat her home to a comfortable temperature:
***"A real eye-opener. Excellent! I found I could do everything for
about £150 and got to work straight away."***

***"There were still places where draughts were coming in and heat
leaking out that I would never have thought of."***

***"We were very pleased with the results of the survey and found the process
very interesting.  We have found the results of the electricity smart reader
useful too and I'm much more conscious now about turning off lights, sockets
etc!"***

***“Measures [sealing round skirting boards in kitchen and lounge, blocking
chimney draught, lagging pipes in cellar] have reduced monthly electricity bill
by £15.”***

From two people who had already made some insulation improvements: ***"Thank
you very much for laying on Brian, Dave and Matt today. Very instructive, some
draught proofing and the like to work on but generally very encouraging for
us."***
