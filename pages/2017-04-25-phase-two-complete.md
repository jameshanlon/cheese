title: Phase two complete

We have come to the end of our winter 2016/17 surveying season, and completion
of phase two of the CHEESE project. Despite some difficulties with funding
early on in the season, we have made some huge achievements. The [pilot last
year](/overview#pilot) was led by thermal imagaing expert Brian Harper, who
conducted the surveys with trainee CHEESE surveyors and provided his own
equipment and energy-saving boxes from his project in Malvern. [This
year](/overview#phase-two) however, we have recruited and trained 12 of our own
Energy Tracer surveyors, who have been operating in teams to deliver surveys
across Bristol. In total, we completed 56 surveys, concentrated in our target
wards, but extending to other areas including Westbury-on-Trym and Stockwood.
Feedback testimonials from households have been very rewarding: "I just wanted
to say how BRILLIANT the Cheese Survey experience was!" and "I have already
started sealing gaps and stuffing holes under skirting boards - I swear its
warmer already!"

This effort has been underpinned by many people, all who are owed a big thanks:
the project director Mike Andrews, our coordinator Nick Clack, the Energy
Tracers, a huge amount of work by Jeremy Birch on the development of and
technical support for our CHEESE thermal imaging kits and the software they
use, the development of our [CHEESE boxes](/cheese-boxes) and sourcing and
construction of 40 of them, the development of the website and survey database
by Jamie Hanlon, and our other CHEESE directors Sue Nicholls and Dave Tudgey.

We are now already looking towards the expansion of the project next winter!
