## Our achievements and plans

Last 2015/16 winter we completed a successful pilot of the CHEESE Project
  in Bristol in Bishopston, Cotham, Redland, Easton and Lawrence Weston.
  We conduced over 50 internal house surveys and captured 11,000 thermal images
  of domestic properties in the same wards for our <a

For this work, the CHEESE project <a

  won the Volunteers for Energy Award</a> at the Bristol
Green Capital Partnership Green Volunteers' Awards 2016.

## What we are planning

Based on the success of our pilot, we are planning to expand the CHEESE
Project in Bristol this winter. We will conduct over 200 internal surveys of
homes and expand the Heatview dataset to include more Bristol streets. From
this experience we will document common faults and remedies and make this
information available to the 200,000 households in Bristol.

In winter 2017/18 we want to double the scale of the CHEESE Project to
survey over 400 houses, and we are keen to establish city partners elsewhere in
the UK.
