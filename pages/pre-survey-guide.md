# Survey information and preparation guide

This page describes what you need to do to prepare for a Cold Homes Energy
Efficiency Survey Experts (CHEESE) survey, what will happen on the day, and how
we will follow up with your progress afterwards.

## Preparation for the survey

In order for us to conduct an efficient and successful survey, we need you to
make some preparations before the survey:

- Retrieve energy bills (electricity, gas and possibly solid fuel) for the last
  three years if they available, or just the last year if not. We need to know
  approximately how many [kilowatt hours (kWh) of
  energy](https://www.ovoenergy.com/guides/energy-guides/what-is-a-kwh-kw-and-kwh-explained.html)
  you use per year, for each type of energy. Please look through your bills and
  calculate the total kWh figures to have them ready. USwitch has some [good
  information](https://www.uswitch.com/gas-electricity/guides/energy-bills/) on
  understanding your energy bills. If you are not sure how to do this, then we
  can calculate them after the survey with you.

- Switch on the central heating for a period of at least 24 hours before the
  survey to warm the fabric of the house up (this is to create a difference of
  at least 10 degrees between the house and the ambient external temperature).

- Switch off/stop any wood burners, open fires, Agas/Rayburns etc. This is
  important since we will reduce the pressure inside the house during the
  survey, and this might draw exhaust gases into the house.

- For the same reason, block or cover any active fireplaces to prevent soot from
  being drawn into rooms.

- Clear away any items that will make it easier to spot draughts and cold spots
  (e.g. on window sills), and to make it safe for the surveyor to move around
  easily without tripping etc.

- Ensure there is a space for our thermal-imaging equipment, such as a kitchen
  table or worktop, and a nearby plug socket for charging.

- Two hours before the survey:
    * Switch off the central heating.
    * Open all curtains and blinds.

## During the survey

Please note:

- Two Energy Tracer surveyors will arrive. One will be the lead Tracer and they
  will usually accompanied by a trainee Tracer who will be shadowing and aiding
  them.

- A blower door will be fitted to a suitable external door. This is used to
  reduce the pressure inside of the house slightly and you will not be able to
  use the door for between 1 and 1.5 hours.

- We expect your participation and engagement throughout the survey, since it
  is led by your knowledge of the building and because it is important you see
  for yourself where heat is being lost.

## Follow ups after the survey

### One month

We will ask you to feedback on the actions you have taken (or plan to take) as
a result of the survey. We would also like to hear any thoughts or comments you
have on the survey and use of the [energy-monitoring pack](/energy-pack), which
we will collect from you around the same time.

### One year

We will contact you one year after the survey by telephone or email to find out
how you are getting on. We would like to know:

- **Your approximate energy use since the survey**. This is to compare with
  the figures we recorded on the day of the survey. We would like you to
  calculate the total kilowatt hours of electricity and gas you have used that
  year as you did before the survey.

- **What actions over the year you have taken to reduce energy use**.

- Any other comments that you might have.
