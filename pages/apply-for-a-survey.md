# Apply for a home survey

We are now booking internal thermal-imaging surveys for this winter, between
November and March. The number of surveys we can do is limited and they will be
offered on a first-come first-served basis.

Please complete the form below to apply for a survey this winter, but before
you do, we ask that you read through the [survey preparation and information
guide](/pre-survey-guide) and are happy to make the necessary preparations for
the survey, and to report your progress back to us after one month and after
one year.

Once you have submitted the form, we will be in contact to organise a date with
you.  If you have any questions about our surveys, then please get in touch by
emailing [surveys@cheeseproject.co.uk](mailto:surveys@cheeseproject.co.uk).
