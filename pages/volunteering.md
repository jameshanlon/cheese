## Volunteering

The CHEESE Project operates on a very small budget and depends on the work
of volunteers for its continued organisation and management. If you are
interested in becoming involved with the project, but not as an Energy Tracer,
there are many other areas where we need help:

- We are looking for volunteers to collect thermal images of buildings to
  expand our <a href="http://www.heatview.co.uk">Heatview map</a>. This will
  involve operating a CHEESE thermal imaging camera, for which there will be a
  short training session provided.

- We would also welcome your help in other areas of the project, such as
  community outreach and promotion of the project, its surveys, and
  opportunities for Energy Tracers; coordination and organisation for surveys;
  social media; website development; and data analysis. We are also open to
  suggestions of ways to improve the project!

If you would like to become involved with CHEESE as a volunteer, or just
want to find out more then please get in touch by emailing
<a href="mailto:info@cheeseproject.co.uk">info@cheeseproject.co.uk</a> to
introduce yourself.
